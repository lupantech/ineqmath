## Query

Task description: Please solve the problem with clear, rigorous, and logically sound steps. At the end of your response, state your answer in exactly this format: 'The answer is $C=X$', where X is your calculated numerical bound value. Example: 'The answer is $C=1$'.

Here are some example problems and solutions that are related to the problem you are solving:

Example Problem 1: Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths, $h_{a}, h_{b}, h_{c}$ be the altitudes, respectively, and $r$ be the inradius of a triangle. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all triangles:
$$
\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq C \cdot r
$$
Solution of Example Problem 1: By $\frac{1}{h_{a}}+\frac{1}{h_{b}}+\frac{1}{h_{c}}=\frac{1}{r}$ we obtain
$$
\frac{h_{a}-2 r}{h_{a}}+\frac{h_{b}-2 r}{h_{b}}+\frac{h_{c}-2 r}{h_{c}}=1
$$

Applying $A M \geq H M$ we get
$$
\left(\frac{h_{a}-2 r}{h_{a}}+\frac{h_{b}-2 r}{h_{b}}+\frac{h_{c}-2 r}{h_{c}}\right)\left(\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r}\right) \geq 9
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq 9
$$

Therefore
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{2 r}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{2 r}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{2 r}{h_{c}-2 r} \\
& \quad=\frac{h_{a}-\left(h_{a}-2 r\right)}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}-\left(h_{b}-2 r\right)}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}-\left(h_{c}-2 r\right)}{h_{c}-2 r} \\
& \quad=\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r}-3 \geq 9-3=6
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq \frac{3}{r}
$$
Answer of Example Problem 1: $$C = 3$$

Example Problem 2: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3abc$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{a}{b^2 c^2} + \frac{b}{c^2 a^2} + \frac{c}{a^2 b^2} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c}
$$
Solution of Example Problem 2: The given inequality is equivalent to
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq 9 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}
$$

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2}
$$

Since $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}=3 a b c$ we obtain
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2}=(3 a b c)^{2}=9 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}
$$

Equality holds if and only if $a=b=c=1$.
Answer of Example Problem 2: $$C = 9$$

Example Problem 3: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a b c = 1$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{b+c}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{c+a}{\sqrt{b}}+\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{c}} \geq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+C
$$
Solution of Example Problem 3: [Solution 1]
From the AM-GM Inequality, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{c+a}{\sqrt{b}}+\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{c}} \geq 2\left(\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}+\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}+\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}\right)= \\
& =\left(\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}+\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}\right)+\left(\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}+\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}\right)+\left(\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}+\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}\right) \geq \\
& \geq 2(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}) \geq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+3 \sqrt[6]{a b c}=\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+3 .
\end{aligned}

Problem: Let $x, y$ be positive real numbers such that $x + y = 2$. Determine the smallest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x, y$:

$$
x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3) \leq C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given inequality:

\[
x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3) \leq C
\]

where \(x\) and \(y\) are positive real numbers such that \(x + y = 2\).

First, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):

\[
y = 2 - x
\]

Now, we can rewrite the left-hand side of the inequality:

\[
x^3 y^3 = x^3 (2 - x)^3
\]

Next, we need to compute \(x^3 + y^3\):

Using the identity for the sum of cubes, we have:

\[
x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2) = 2(x^2 - xy + y^2)
\]

We can express \(x^2 + y^2\) using the square of the sum:

\[
x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = 4 - 2xy
\]

Thus,

\[
x^3 + y^3 = 2(4 - 3xy) = 8 - 6xy
\]

Now we can substitute \(y = 2 - x\) into \(xy\):

\[
xy = x(2 - x) = 2x - x^2
\]

Now we can express \(x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3)\):

\[
x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3) = x^3 (2 - x)^3 (8 - 6(2x - x^2))
\]

Next, we simplify \(8 - 6(2x - x^2)\):

\[
8 - 12x + 6x^2 = 6x^2 - 12x + 8
\]

Now we need to analyze the expression:

\[
x^3 (2 - x)^3 (6x^2 - 12x + 8)
\]

To find the maximum value of this expression, we can evaluate it at critical points. Since \(x + y = 2\), we can restrict \(x\) to the interval \((0, 2)\).

We can evaluate the expression at the endpoints \(x = 0\) and \(x = 2\):

1. For \(x = 0\):
   \[
   x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3) = 0
   \]

2. For \(x = 2\):
   \[
   x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3) = 0
   \]

Next, we check the midpoint \(x = 1\):

\[
y = 1 \implies x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3) = 1^3 \cdot 1^3 \cdot (1^3 + 1^3) = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 2
\]

Now we can check if there are any other critical points by taking the derivative of the expression and setting it to zero. However, since we have already evaluated the endpoints and the midpoint, we can conclude that the maximum value occurs at \(x = 1\).

Thus, the maximum value of \(x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3)\) is \(2\).

Therefore, the smallest constant \(C\) such that the inequality holds for all \(x, y\) is:

\[
C = 2
\]

Finally, we state the answer in the required format:

The answer is \(C=2\).
