## Query

Task description: Please solve the problem with clear, rigorous, and logically sound steps. At the end of your response, state your answer in exactly this format: 'The answer is $C=X$', where X is your calculated numerical bound value. Example: 'The answer is $C=1$'.

Here are some example problems and solutions that are related to the problem you are solving:

Example Problem 1: Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths, $h_{a}, h_{b}, h_{c}$ be the altitudes, respectively, and $r$ be the inradius of a triangle. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all triangles:
$$
\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq C \cdot r
$$
Solution of Example Problem 1: By $\frac{1}{h_{a}}+\frac{1}{h_{b}}+\frac{1}{h_{c}}=\frac{1}{r}$ we obtain
$$
\frac{h_{a}-2 r}{h_{a}}+\frac{h_{b}-2 r}{h_{b}}+\frac{h_{c}-2 r}{h_{c}}=1
$$

Applying $A M \geq H M$ we get
$$
\left(\frac{h_{a}-2 r}{h_{a}}+\frac{h_{b}-2 r}{h_{b}}+\frac{h_{c}-2 r}{h_{c}}\right)\left(\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r}\right) \geq 9
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq 9
$$

Therefore
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{2 r}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{2 r}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{2 r}{h_{c}-2 r} \\
& \quad=\frac{h_{a}-\left(h_{a}-2 r\right)}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}-\left(h_{b}-2 r\right)}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}-\left(h_{c}-2 r\right)}{h_{c}-2 r} \\
& \quad=\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r}-3 \geq 9-3=6
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq \frac{3}{r}
$$
Answer of Example Problem 1: $$C = 3$$

Example Problem 2: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3abc$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{a}{b^2 c^2} + \frac{b}{c^2 a^2} + \frac{c}{a^2 b^2} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c}
$$
Solution of Example Problem 2: The given inequality is equivalent to
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq 9 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}
$$

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2}
$$

Since $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}=3 a b c$ we obtain
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2}=(3 a b c)^{2}=9 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}
$$

Equality holds if and only if $a=b=c=1$.
Answer of Example Problem 2: $$C = 9$$

Example Problem 3: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a b c = 1$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{b+c}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{c+a}{\sqrt{b}}+\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{c}} \geq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+C
$$
Solution of Example Problem 3: [Solution 1]
From the AM-GM Inequality, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{c+a}{\sqrt{b}}+\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{c}} \geq 2\left(\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}+\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}+\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}\right)= \\
& =\left(\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}+\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}\right)+\left(\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}+\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}\right)+\left(\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}+\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}\right) \geq \\
& \geq 2(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}) \geq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+3 \sqrt[6]{a b c}=\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+3 .
\end{aligned}
$$

Problem: Let $x > 4$. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x$:

$$
\frac{x^3}{x-4} \geq C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality 

\[
\frac{x^3}{x-4} \geq C
\]

for \( x > 4 \). We can rearrange this inequality to find a lower bound for \( C \):

\[
\frac{x^3}{x-4} - C \geq 0.
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{x^3 - C(x-4)}{x-4} \geq 0.
\]

To ensure that the left-hand side is non-negative, we need to analyze the numerator:

\[
x^3 - C(x-4) = x^3 - Cx + 4C.
\]

We want to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the expression \( x^3 - Cx + 4C \) is non-negative for all \( x > 4 \). 

To do this, we can consider the function:

\[
f(x) = x^3 - Cx + 4C.
\]

We will find the critical points of \( f(x) \) by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 3x^2 - C.
\]

Setting \( f'(x) = 0 \) gives:

\[
3x^2 = C \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 = \frac{C}{3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \sqrt{\frac{C}{3}}.
\]

Since we are interested in \( x > 4 \), we require:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{C}{3}} > 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{C}{3} > 16 \quad \Rightarrow \quad C > 48.
\]

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = 4 \) to find the minimum value of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 4 from the right:

\[
f(4) = 4^3 - C(4) + 4C = 64 - 4C + 4C = 64.
\]

Thus, \( f(4) = 64 \) is positive, and we need to ensure that \( f(x) \) remains non-negative for \( x > 4 \). 

To find the largest \( C \) such that \( f(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x > 4 \), we can analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to \infty \):

As \( x \to \infty \), \( f(x) \) behaves like \( x^3 \), which is positive. Therefore, the critical point we found is the only point we need to check.

To ensure that \( f(x) \) does not dip below zero, we can set \( C = 48 \) and check if \( f(x) \) is non-negative:

\[
f(x) = x^3 - 48x + 192.
\]

Now we need to check if this polynomial has any real roots for \( x > 4 \). The discriminant of the quadratic \( 3x^2 - 48 = 0 \) gives:

\[
x^2 = 16 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 4.
\]

Since \( f(4) = 64 \) is positive and \( f(x) \to \infty \) as \( x \to \infty \), we conclude that \( f(x) \) is non-negative for \( x > 4 \).

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( x > 4 \) is:

\[
C = 48.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is \( C=48 \).
