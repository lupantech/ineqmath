## Query

Task description: Please solve the problem with clear, rigorous, and logically sound steps. At the end of your response, state your answer in exactly this format: 'The answer is $C=X$', where X is your calculated numerical bound value. Example: 'The answer is $C=1$'.

Here are some example problems and solutions that are related to the problem you are solving:

Example Problem 1: Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths, $h_{a}, h_{b}, h_{c}$ be the altitudes, respectively, and $r$ be the inradius of a triangle. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all triangles:
$$
\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq C \cdot r
$$
Solution of Example Problem 1: By $\frac{1}{h_{a}}+\frac{1}{h_{b}}+\frac{1}{h_{c}}=\frac{1}{r}$ we obtain
$$
\frac{h_{a}-2 r}{h_{a}}+\frac{h_{b}-2 r}{h_{b}}+\frac{h_{c}-2 r}{h_{c}}=1
$$

Applying $A M \geq H M$ we get
$$
\left(\frac{h_{a}-2 r}{h_{a}}+\frac{h_{b}-2 r}{h_{b}}+\frac{h_{c}-2 r}{h_{c}}\right)\left(\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r}\right) \geq 9
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq 9
$$

Therefore
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{2 r}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{2 r}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{2 r}{h_{c}-2 r} \\
& \quad=\frac{h_{a}-\left(h_{a}-2 r\right)}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}-\left(h_{b}-2 r\right)}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}-\left(h_{c}-2 r\right)}{h_{c}-2 r} \\
& \quad=\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r}-3 \geq 9-3=6
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq \frac{3}{r}
$$
Answer of Example Problem 1: $$C = 3$$

Example Problem 2: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3abc$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{a}{b^2 c^2} + \frac{b}{c^2 a^2} + \frac{c}{a^2 b^2} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c}
$$
Solution of Example Problem 2: The given inequality is equivalent to
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq 9 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}
$$

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2}
$$

Since $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}=3 a b c$ we obtain
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2}=(3 a b c)^{2}=9 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}
$$

Equality holds if and only if $a=b=c=1$.
Answer of Example Problem 2: $$C = 9$$

Example Problem 3: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a b c = 1$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{b+c}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{c+a}{\sqrt{b}}+\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{c}} \geq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+C
$$
Solution of Example Problem 3: [Solution 1]
From the AM-GM Inequality, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{c+a}{\sqrt{b}}+\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{c}} \geq 2\left(\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}+\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}+\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}\right)= \\
& =\left(\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}+\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}\right)+\left(\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}+\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}\right)+\left(\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}+\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}\right) \geq \\
& \geq 2(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}) \geq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+3 \sqrt[6]{a b c}=\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+3 .
\end{aligned}

Problem: Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(x+1)(y+2) = 8$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x, y$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
|x y - 10| \geq C
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the constraint given by the equation:

\[
(x+1)(y+2) = 8.
\]

Expanding this, we have:

\[
xy + 2x + y + 2 = 8 \implies xy + 2x + y = 6.
\]

We want to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
|xy - 10| \geq C
\]

holds for all \( x, y \) satisfying the constraint.

First, we can express \( xy \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \):

\[
xy = 6 - 2x - y.
\]

Next, we can substitute \( y \) from the constraint into the expression for \( xy \). From the constraint, we can express \( y \) as:

\[
y = \frac{8}{x+1} - 2.
\]

Substituting this into the expression for \( xy \):

\[
xy = x\left(\frac{8}{x+1} - 2\right) = \frac{8x}{x+1} - 2x.
\]

Now, we simplify this expression:

\[
xy = \frac{8x - 2x(x+1)}{x+1} = \frac{8x - 2x^2 - 2x}{x+1} = \frac{-2x^2 + 6x}{x+1}.
\]

Next, we need to analyze the expression \( |xy - 10| \):

\[
|xy - 10| = \left| \frac{-2x^2 + 6x}{x+1} - 10 \right| = \left| \frac{-2x^2 + 6x - 10(x+1)}{x+1} \right| = \left| \frac{-2x^2 + 6x - 10x - 10}{x+1} \right| = \left| \frac{-2x^2 - 4x - 10}{x+1} \right|.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
|xy - 10| = \frac{|2x^2 + 4x + 10|}{|x+1|}.
\]

Next, we need to find the minimum value of \( |xy - 10| \). The quadratic \( 2x^2 + 4x + 10 \) is always positive since its discriminant is negative:

\[
D = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 10 = 16 - 80 = -64.
\]

Thus, \( 2x^2 + 4x + 10 \) has no real roots and is always positive. Therefore, we can focus on the minimum value of \( |xy - 10| \).

To find the minimum value of \( |xy - 10| \), we can evaluate \( xy \) at the boundary conditions of the constraint. We can set \( (x+1)(y+2) = 8 \) and analyze the values of \( xy \) as \( x \) and \( y \) vary.

1. **When \( x = 0 \)**:
   \[
   (0+1)(y+2) = 8 \implies y + 2 = 8 \implies y = 6 \implies xy = 0 \cdot 6 = 0.
   \]

2. **When \( y = 0 \)**:
   \[
   (x+1)(0+2) = 8 \implies 2(x+1) = 8 \implies x + 1 = 4 \implies x = 3 \implies xy = 3 \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]

3. **When \( x = 1 \)**:
   \[
   (1+1)(y+2) = 8 \implies 2(y+2) = 8 \implies y + 2 = 4 \implies y = 2 \implies xy = 1 \cdot 2 = 2.
   \]

4. **When \( x = 2 \)**:
   \[
   (2+1)(y+2) = 8 \implies 3(y+2) = 8 \implies y + 2 = \frac{8}{3} \implies y = \frac{8}{3} - 2 = \frac{2}{3} \implies xy = 2 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{3}.
   \]

5. **When \( x = 3 \)**:
   \[
   (3+1)(y+2) = 8 \implies 4(y+2) = 8 \implies y + 2 = 2 \implies y = 0 \implies xy = 3 \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]

From these evaluations, we find that the minimum value of \( xy \) is \( 0 \) and the maximum value is \( 2 \). Thus, we can calculate:

\[
|xy - 10| \text{ has a minimum value of } |0 - 10| = 10.
\]

Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( x, y \) satisfying the constraint is:

\[
C = 10.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is \( C=10 \).
