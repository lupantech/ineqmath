## Query

Task description: Please solve the problem with clear, rigorous, and logically sound steps. At the end of your response, state your answer in exactly this format: 'The answer is $C=X$', where X is your calculated numerical bound value. Example: 'The answer is $C=1$'.

Here are some example problems and solutions that are related to the problem you are solving:

Example Problem 1: Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths, $h_{a}, h_{b}, h_{c}$ be the altitudes, respectively, and $r$ be the inradius of a triangle. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all triangles:
$$
\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq C \cdot r
$$
Solution of Example Problem 1: By $\frac{1}{h_{a}}+\frac{1}{h_{b}}+\frac{1}{h_{c}}=\frac{1}{r}$ we obtain
$$
\frac{h_{a}-2 r}{h_{a}}+\frac{h_{b}-2 r}{h_{b}}+\frac{h_{c}-2 r}{h_{c}}=1
$$

Applying $A M \geq H M$ we get
$$
\left(\frac{h_{a}-2 r}{h_{a}}+\frac{h_{b}-2 r}{h_{b}}+\frac{h_{c}-2 r}{h_{c}}\right)\left(\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r}\right) \geq 9
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq 9
$$

Therefore
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{2 r}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{2 r}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{2 r}{h_{c}-2 r} \\
& \quad=\frac{h_{a}-\left(h_{a}-2 r\right)}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}-\left(h_{b}-2 r\right)}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}-\left(h_{c}-2 r\right)}{h_{c}-2 r} \\
& \quad=\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r}-3 \geq 9-3=6
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq \frac{3}{r}
$$
Answer of Example Problem 1: $$C = 3$$

Example Problem 2: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3abc$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{a}{b^2 c^2} + \frac{b}{c^2 a^2} + \frac{c}{a^2 b^2} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c}
$$
Solution of Example Problem 2: The given inequality is equivalent to
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq 9 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}
$$

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2}
$$

Since $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}=3 a b c$ we obtain
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2}=(3 a b c)^{2}=9 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}
$$

Equality holds if and only if $a=b=c=1$.
Answer of Example Problem 2: $$C = 9$$

Example Problem 3: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a b c = 1$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{b+c}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{c+a}{\sqrt{b}}+\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{c}} \geq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+C
$$
Solution of Example Problem 3: [Solution 1]
From the AM-GM Inequality, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{c+a}{\sqrt{b}}+\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{c}} \geq 2\left(\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}+\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}+\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}\right)= \\
& =\left(\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}+\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}\right)+\left(\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}+\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}\right)+\left(\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}+\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}\right) \geq \\
& \geq 2(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}) \geq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+3 \sqrt[6]{a b c}=\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+3 .
\end{aligned}

Problem: Given four real numbers $a, b, c, d \geq 0$ satisfying $a \geq b + 7c + d$, find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$:

$$
7(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a) \geq C a b c d
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given inequality:

\[
7(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a) \geq C a b c d
\]

We need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that this inequality holds for all non-negative real numbers \( a, b, c, d \) satisfying \( a \geq b + 7c + d \).

### Step 1: Analyze the condition

The condition \( a \geq b + 7c + d \) implies that \( a \) is at least as large as the sum of \( b \), \( 7c \), and \( d \). This suggests that \( a \) can be significantly larger than the other variables, especially when \( c \) is non-zero.

### Step 2: Simplify the inequality

To explore the inequality, we can set specific values for \( b, c, d \) to see how \( C \) behaves. A natural choice is to set \( b = 0 \), \( c = 0 \), and \( d = 0 \). This gives us:

\[
7(a+0)(0+0)(0+0)(0+a) = 0 \geq C \cdot a \cdot 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 = 0
\]

This is trivially true for any \( C \).

### Step 3: Test with non-zero values

Next, we can set \( b = 0 \), \( c = 1 \), and \( d = 0 \). Then, the condition becomes:

\[
a \geq 0 + 7 \cdot 1 + 0 = 7
\]

Now, substituting into the inequality:

\[
7(a+0)(0+1)(1+0)(0+a) = 7a \geq C \cdot a \cdot 0 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 0
\]

This is again trivially true.

### Step 4: Choose more values

Now, letâ€™s set \( b = 1 \), \( c = 1 \), and \( d = 1 \). The condition becomes:

\[
a \geq 1 + 7 \cdot 1 + 1 = 9
\]

Substituting into the inequality gives:

\[
7(a+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+a) = 7(a+1)(2)(2)(a+1) = 28(a+1)^2
\]

We need this to be greater than or equal to \( C \cdot a \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = C a \).

### Step 5: Find the bound for \( C \)

Thus, we have:

\[
28(a+1)^2 \geq C a
\]

Dividing both sides by \( a \) (valid since \( a \geq 9 > 0 \)) gives:

\[
28 \frac{(a+1)^2}{a} \geq C
\]

Now, simplifying \( \frac{(a+1)^2}{a} \):

\[
\frac{(a+1)^2}{a} = \frac{a^2 + 2a + 1}{a} = a + 2 + \frac{1}{a}
\]

As \( a \) approaches infinity, \( a + 2 + \frac{1}{a} \) approaches \( a + 2 \). Thus, we can find a lower bound for \( C \):

\[
C \leq 28(a + 2)
\]

### Step 6: Evaluate at \( a = 9 \)

To find the maximum \( C \), we can evaluate at \( a = 9 \):

\[
C \leq 28(9 + 2) = 28 \cdot 11 = 308
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all non-negative \( a, b, c, d \) satisfying the given condition is:

\[
\boxed{308}
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is \( C=308 \).
