Problem: Let $a, b, c \in \left[\frac{1}{3}, 3\right]$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ in the given range:
$$
\frac{a}{a+b}+\frac{b}{b+c}+\frac{c}{c+a} \geq C.
$$

Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{a}{a+b} + \frac{b}{b+c} + \frac{c}{c+a} \geq C
\]

holds for all \( a, b, c \in \left[\frac{1}{3}, 3\right] \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Expression

We start by analyzing the left-hand side of the inequality:

\[
S = \frac{a}{a+b} + \frac{b}{b+c} + \frac{c}{c+a}
\]

Each term in \( S \) is a fraction where the numerator is a variable and the denominator is the sum of that variable and another variable. 

### Step 2: Find the Minimum Value of \( S \)

To find the minimum value of \( S \), we can evaluate it at the endpoints of the interval \( \left[\frac{1}{3}, 3\right] \). We will check the cases where \( a, b, c \) take on the extreme values of the interval.

#### Case 1: \( a = b = c = \frac{1}{3} \)

\[
S = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}} + \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}} + \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}} = 3 \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{2}{3}} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

#### Case 2: \( a = b = c = 3 \)

\[
S = \frac{3}{3+3} + \frac{3}{3+3} + \frac{3}{3+3} = 3 \cdot \frac{3}{6} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

#### Case 3: \( a = b = 3, c = \frac{1}{3} \)

\[
S = \frac{3}{3+3} + \frac{3}{3+\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3}+3} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{3}{\frac{10}{3}} + \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{10}{3}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{9}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{2} + 1 = \frac{3}{2}
\]

#### Case 4: \( a = \frac{1}{3}, b = 3, c = 3 \)

\[
S = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3}+3} + \frac{3}{3+3} + \frac{3}{3+\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{10}{3}} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{9}{10} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{9}{10} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{5}{10} + \frac{9}{10} = \frac{15}{10} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion

From the evaluations above, we see that in all cases, the minimum value of \( S \) is \( \frac{3}{2} \). Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a, b, c \in \left[\frac{1}{3}, 3\right] \) is:

\[
C = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C = \frac{3}{2}
\]
