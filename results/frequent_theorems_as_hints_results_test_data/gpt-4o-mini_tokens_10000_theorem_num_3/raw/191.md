Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression \(3ab + 4bc + 5ca\) under the constraint \(a + b + c = 1\). We will explore the maximum value of this expression and compare it to \(\frac{5}{3}\).

### Step 1: Express \(c\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\)

From the constraint \(a + b + c = 1\), we can express \(c\) as:
\[
c = 1 - a - b.
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \(c\) into the expression

Substituting \(c\) into the expression \(3ab + 4bc + 5ca\), we get:
\[
3ab + 4b(1 - a - b) + 5a(1 - a - b).
\]
Expanding this, we have:
\[
3ab + 4b - 4ab - 4b^2 + 5a - 5a^2 - 5ab.
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
(3ab - 4ab - 5ab) + (4b) + (5a) - 4b^2 - 5a^2 = -6ab + 4b + 5a - 4b^2 - 5a^2.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the expression

We can rewrite the expression as:
\[
-5a^2 - 6ab - 4b^2 + 5a + 4b.
\]
This is a quadratic expression in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the critical points directly.

### Step 4: Use symmetry and test specific values

To simplify our analysis, we can test specific values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy \(a + b + c = 1\).

1. **Case 1**: Let \(a = 1\), \(b = 0\), \(c = 0\):
   \[
   3(1)(0) + 4(0)(0) + 5(0)(1) = 0.
   \]

2. **Case 2**: Let \(a = 0\), \(b = 1\), \(c = 0\):
   \[
   3(0)(1) + 4(1)(0) + 5(0)(0) = 0.
   \]

3. **Case 3**: Let \(a = 0\), \(b = 0\), \(c = 1\):
   \[
   3(0)(0) + 4(0)(1) + 5(1)(0) = 0.
   \]

4. **Case 4**: Let \(a = \frac{1}{3}\), \(b = \frac{1}{3}\), \(c = \frac{1}{3}\):
   \[
   3\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + 4\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + 5\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 3\left(\frac{1}{9}\right) + 4\left(\frac{1}{9}\right) + 5\left(\frac{1}{9}\right) = \frac{3 + 4 + 5}{9} = \frac{12}{9} = \frac{4}{3}.
   \]

### Step 5: Compare with \(\frac{5}{3}\)

The maximum value we found is \(\frac{4}{3}\). Now we compare this with \(\frac{5}{3}\):
\[
\frac{4}{3} < \frac{5}{3}.
\]

### Conclusion

Since the maximum value of \(3ab + 4bc + 5ca\) is \(\frac{4}{3}\), which is less than \(\frac{5}{3}\), we conclude that:
\[
3ab + 4bc + 5ca \leq \frac{5}{3}.
\]

Thus, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:
\[
\text{The answer is (A) } \leq.
\]
