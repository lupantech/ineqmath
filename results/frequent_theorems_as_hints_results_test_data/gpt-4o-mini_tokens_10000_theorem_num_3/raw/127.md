Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression 

\[
S = \frac{a_1}{a_2} + \frac{a_2}{a_3} + \cdots + \frac{a_n}{a_1}
\]

and compare it to \(2n - 1\).

### Step 1: Understanding the constraints

We know that all \(a_k > 1\) and that the differences between consecutive terms are bounded:

\[
|a_k - a_{k+1}| \leq 1 \quad \text{for } 1 \leq k \leq n-1.
\]

This implies that the sequence \(a_k\) cannot vary too much from one term to the next.

### Step 2: Establishing bounds for the ratios

Given the condition \(|a_k - a_{k+1}| \leq 1\), we can derive bounds for the ratios \(\frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}}\):

1. If \(a_k \leq a_{k+1}\), then \(a_{k+1} \leq a_k + 1\) implies:
   \[
   \frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}} \geq \frac{a_k}{a_k + 1}.
   \]

2. If \(a_k \geq a_{k+1}\), then \(a_{k+1} \geq a_k - 1\) implies:
   \[
   \frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}} \leq \frac{a_k}{a_k - 1}.
   \]

### Step 3: Analyzing the sum \(S\)

To analyze \(S\), we can use the bounds derived above. We can express \(S\) in terms of the average of the ratios:

\[
S = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}}.
\]

Using the bounds, we can estimate \(S\):

- Each term \(\frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}}\) is at least \(\frac{a_k}{a_k + 1}\) and at most \(\frac{a_k}{a_k - 1}\).

### Step 4: Finding a lower bound for \(S\)

Using the lower bound for each term:

\[
S \geq \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{a_k}{a_k + 1}.
\]

Now, since \(a_k > 1\), we have:

\[
\frac{a_k}{a_k + 1} = 1 - \frac{1}{a_k + 1} < 1.
\]

Thus, 

\[
S < n.
\]

### Step 5: Finding an upper bound for \(S\)

Using the upper bound for each term:

\[
S \leq \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{a_k}{a_k - 1}.
\]

For \(a_k > 1\), we have:

\[
\frac{a_k}{a_k - 1} = 1 + \frac{1}{a_k - 1} > 1.
\]

Thus, 

\[
S > n.
\]

### Step 6: Conclusion

From the analysis, we have established that:

\[
n < S < 2n.
\]

This implies that \(S\) is always greater than \(2n - 1\) because \(S\) cannot reach \(2n\) and is strictly greater than \(n\).

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
S \geq 2n - 1.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
