    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) in relation to the circumcenter \\(O\\) and the circumradius \\(R\\) of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**:\n   - The circumcenter \\(O\\) is the center of the circumcircle of triangle \\(ABC\\) with radius \\(R\\).\n   - The points \\(D\\), \\(E\\), and \\(F\\) are defined as the intersections of the lines \\(AO\\), \\(BO\\), and \\(CO\\) with the circumcircles of triangles \\(OBC\\), \\(OCA\\), and \\(OAB\\) respectively.\n\n2. **Using Power of a Point**:\n   - The power of point \\(O\\) with respect to the circumcircle of triangle \\(OBC\\) gives us:\n     \\[\n     OD \\cdot OA = R^2\n     \\]\n     where \\(OA = R\\) (the radius of the circumcircle). Thus, we have:\n     \\[\n     OD = \\frac{R^2}{OA} = \\frac{R^2}{R} = R.\n     \\]\n   - Similarly, we can find:\n     \\[\n     OE = R \\quad \\text{and} \\quad OF = R.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Product**:\n   - Now we can compute the product \\(O D \\cdot O E \\cdot O F\\):\n     \\[\n     O D \\cdot O E \\cdot O F = R \\cdot R \\cdot R = R^3.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Establishing the Inequality**:\n   - We need to find the largest constant \\(C\\) such that:\n     \\[\n     O D \\cdot O E \\cdot O F \\geq C R^3.\n     \\]\n   - From our calculation, we have:\n     \\[\n     R^3 \\geq C R^3.\n     \\]\n   - Dividing both sides by \\(R^3\\) (which is positive since \\(R\\) is the circumradius of an acute triangle), we get:\n     \\[\n     1 \\geq C.\n     \\]\n   - This implies that the largest constant \\(C\\) that satisfies the inequality for all acute triangles is \\(C = 1\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, the largest constant \\(C\\) such that the inequality holds for all acute triangles \\(ABC\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\nThe answer is \\(C=1\\).",
