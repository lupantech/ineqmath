Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression 

\[
E = \frac{a \sqrt{b}}{a+b} + \frac{b \sqrt{c}}{b+c} + \frac{c \sqrt{a}}{c+a} + 1
\]

and compare it to 

\[
2a + 2b + c.
\]

### Step 1: Analyze Each Term

We will analyze each term of the expression \(E\) using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 

For the first term, we apply Cauchy-Schwarz:

\[
\frac{a \sqrt{b}}{a+b} = \frac{a \sqrt{b}}{a+b} \cdot \frac{(a+b)}{(a+b)} = \frac{a^2 b + ab}{(a+b)^2} \leq \frac{a^2 + b}{2}.
\]

This gives us:

\[
\frac{a \sqrt{b}}{a+b} \leq \frac{a^2 + b}{2}.
\]

Similarly, we can analyze the other two terms:

\[
\frac{b \sqrt{c}}{b+c} \leq \frac{b^2 + c}{2},
\]
\[
\frac{c \sqrt{a}}{c+a} \leq \frac{c^2 + a}{2}.
\]

### Step 2: Combine the Inequalities

Now, we can combine these inequalities:

\[
E \leq \frac{a^2 + b}{2} + \frac{b^2 + c}{2} + \frac{c^2 + a}{2} + 1.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
E \leq \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + a + b + c}{2} + 1.
\]

### Step 3: Compare with \(2a + 2b + c\)

Next, we need to compare this upper bound of \(E\) with \(2a + 2b + c\). 

To do this, we can analyze the expression:

\[
\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + a + b + c}{2} + 1 \quad \text{and} \quad 2a + 2b + c.
\]

### Step 4: Establish a Lower Bound

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again, we can establish that:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{3}.
\]

Thus, we can write:

\[
E \leq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{6} + 1.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the Growth of Each Side

Now, we need to analyze the growth of both sides as \(a, b, c\) increase. 

1. The left-hand side \(E\) grows slower than \(2a + 2b + c\) because the terms in \(E\) are fractions of \(a, b, c\) divided by their sums, which limits their growth.
2. The right-hand side \(2a + 2b + c\) grows linearly with respect to \(a, b, c\).

### Conclusion

Given that \(E\) is bounded above by a function that grows slower than \(2a + 2b + c\), we conclude that:

\[
E < 2a + 2b + c.
\]

Thus, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
