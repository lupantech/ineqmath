    "response": "To solve the problem, we start with the given recurrence relation for the sequence \\( (a_n)_{n \\geq 0} \\):\n\n\\[\na_{n+1} \\geq a_n^2 + \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\nWe will analyze the behavior of the sequence \\( a_n \\) and then compare \\( \\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \\) with \\( a_{n-5}^2 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Establish a lower bound for \\( a_n \\)\n\nWe can use the recurrence relation to derive a lower bound for \\( a_n \\). Let's denote \\( a_0 \\) as the initial term of the sequence. We can compute a few terms:\n\n- For \\( n = 0 \\):\n  \\[\n  a_1 \\geq a_0^2 + \\frac{1}{5}\n  \\]\n\n- For \\( n = 1 \\):\n  \\[\n  a_2 \\geq a_1^2 + \\frac{1}{5} \\geq (a_0^2 + \\frac{1}{5})^2 + \\frac{1}{5}\n  \\]\n\nContinuing this process, we can see that each term is at least as large as the square of the previous term plus a constant. This suggests that the sequence grows rapidly.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the growth of \\( a_n \\)\n\nAssuming \\( a_n \\) is non-negative, we can see that if \\( a_n \\) is large, then \\( a_{n+1} \\) will be even larger due to the squaring term. This indicates that \\( a_n \\) is likely to grow without bound.\n\n### Step 3: Compare \\( \\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \\) and \\( a_{n-5}^2 \\)\n\nNow, we need to analyze the inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \\quad () \\quad a_{n-5}^2\n\\]\n\nTo do this, we will use the recurrence relation iteratively to express \\( a_{n+5} \\) in terms of earlier terms.\n\nFrom the recurrence relation, we have:\n\n\\[\na_{n+5} \\geq a_{n+4}^2 + \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\na_{n+4} \\geq a_{n+3}^2 + \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\na_{n+3} \\geq a_{n+2}^2 + \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\na_{n+2} \\geq a_{n+1}^2 + \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\na_{n+1} \\geq a_n^2 + \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\nBy continuing this process, we can see that \\( a_{n+5} \\) is at least as large as a function of \\( a_n \\) raised to a power, plus a constant. \n\n### Step 4: Establish the relationship\n\nGiven that \\( a_n \\) grows rapidly, we can intuitively argue that:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \\geq a_{n-5}^2\n\\]\n\nThis is because \\( a_{n+5} \\) is derived from squaring terms that are already large, while \\( a_{n-5}^2 \\) is just the square of a term that is further back in the sequence. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, we conclude that:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \\geq a_{n-5}^2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:\n\nThe answer is (B) $\\geq$.",
