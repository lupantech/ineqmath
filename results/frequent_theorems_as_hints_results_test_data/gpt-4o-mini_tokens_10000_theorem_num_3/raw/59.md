Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition:

\[
\frac{1}{x_1 + 1998} + \frac{1}{x_2 + 1998} + \cdots + \frac{1}{x_n + 1998} = \frac{1}{1998}.
\]

We can rewrite this condition in a more manageable form. Multiplying both sides by \(1998(x_1 + 1998)(x_2 + 1998) \cdots (x_n + 1998)\) gives:

\[
1998 \left( \frac{(x_2 + 1998)(x_3 + 1998) \cdots (x_n + 1998)}{x_1 + 1998} + \cdots + \frac{(x_1 + 1998)(x_3 + 1998) \cdots (x_n + 1998)}{x_2 + 1998} \right) = (x_1 + 1998)(x_2 + 1998) \cdots (x_n + 1998).
\]

However, we will use the harmonic mean (HM) and the arithmetic mean (AM) to derive a useful inequality. The harmonic mean of the terms \(x_i + 1998\) is given by:

\[
HM = \frac{n}{\frac{1}{x_1 + 1998} + \frac{1}{x_2 + 1998} + \cdots + \frac{1}{x_n + 1998}} = \frac{n \cdot 1998}{1} = 1998n.
\]

By the AM-HM inequality, we have:

\[
AM \geq HM.
\]

The arithmetic mean of the terms \(x_i + 1998\) is:

\[
AM = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n + 1998n}{n}.
\]

Thus, we can write:

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n + 1998n}{n} \geq 1998n.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n + 1998n \geq 1998n.
\]

Subtracting \(1998n\) from both sides gives:

\[
x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n \geq 0.
\]

This is trivially true since \(x_i\) are positive numbers. 

Next, we apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\):

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}.
\]

Let \(G = \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}\). Then we have:

\[
x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n \geq nG.
\]

Now, we need to relate \(G\) to the constant \(C\) in the inequality:

\[
\frac{G}{n-1} \geq C.
\]

From the harmonic mean condition, we know that:

\[
\frac{1}{x_1 + 1998} + \frac{1}{x_2 + 1998} + \cdots + \frac{1}{x_n + 1998} = \frac{1}{1998}.
\]

This implies that the average of the \(x_i + 1998\) is bounded. We can find a specific case to maximize \(C\). 

Assuming \(x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n = x\), we have:

\[
\frac{n}{x + 1998} = \frac{1}{1998} \implies n = \frac{x + 1998}{1998} \implies x = 1998 \left( \frac{n - 1}{n} \right).
\]

Substituting this back into the geometric mean gives:

\[
G = \sqrt[n]{x^n} = x = 1998 \left( \frac{n - 1}{n} \right).
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{G}{n-1} = \frac{1998 \left( \frac{n - 1}{n} \right)}{n - 1} = \frac{1998}{n}.
\]

To find the largest constant \(C\), we take the limit as \(n\) approaches infinity:

\[
C = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1998}{n} = 0.
\]

However, we need to find the largest constant \(C\) that holds for all \(n\). The maximum occurs when \(n = 2\):

\[
C = \frac{1998}{2} = 999.
\]

Thus, the largest constant \(C\) such that the inequality holds for all \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) is:

\[
\boxed{999}.
\]

Finally, we state the answer in the required format:

The answer is \(C=999\).
