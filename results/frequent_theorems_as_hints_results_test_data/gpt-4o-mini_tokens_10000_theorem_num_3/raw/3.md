Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression 

\[
S = \frac{1+a+b}{2+c} + \frac{1+b+c}{2+a} + \frac{1+c+a}{2+b}
\]

given the constraint \( a + b + c = 1 \) with \( a, b, c > 0 \). We want to find the maximal constant \( C \) such that \( S \geq C \) for all positive \( a, b, c \).

First, we can rewrite the terms in \( S \):

1. The first term can be rewritten as:
   \[
   \frac{1 + a + b}{2 + c} = \frac{1 + (a + b)}{2 + c} = \frac{1 + (1 - c)}{2 + c} = \frac{2 - c}{2 + c}
   \]

2. The second term becomes:
   \[
   \frac{1 + b + c}{2 + a} = \frac{2 - a}{2 + a}
   \]

3. The third term becomes:
   \[
   \frac{1 + c + a}{2 + b} = \frac{2 - b}{2 + b}
   \]

Thus, we can express \( S \) as:

\[
S = \frac{2 - c}{2 + c} + \frac{2 - a}{2 + a} + \frac{2 - b}{2 + b}
\]

Next, we will analyze the behavior of \( S \) under the constraint \( a + b + c = 1 \). To find a lower bound for \( S \), we can use the method of symmetry by setting \( a = b = c = \frac{1}{3} \).

Calculating \( S \) at \( a = b = c = \frac{1}{3} \):

\[
S = 3 \cdot \frac{2 - \frac{1}{3}}{2 + \frac{1}{3}} = 3 \cdot \frac{\frac{6 - 1}{3}}{\frac{6 + 1}{3}} = 3 \cdot \frac{5/3}{7/3} = 3 \cdot \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{7}
\]

Now, we need to check if \( S \) can be less than \( \frac{15}{7} \) for other values of \( a, b, c \). 

To do this, we can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^{3} \frac{1 + a_i}{2 + b_i} \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^{3} (2 + b_i) \right) \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^{3} (1 + a_i) \right)^2
\]

Let \( a_1 = a, a_2 = b, a_3 = c \) and \( b_1 = b_2 = b_3 = 2 \). Then we have:

\[
S \cdot (6 + a + b + c) \geq (3 + a + b + c)^2
\]

Since \( a + b + c = 1 \):

\[
S \cdot 7 \geq 16 \implies S \geq \frac{16}{7}
\]

Thus, we have established that \( S \geq \frac{16}{7} \) for all positive \( a, b, c \) such that \( a + b + c = 1 \).

Finally, we need to check if \( S \) can achieve \( \frac{16}{7} \). Testing the case where \( a = b = c = \frac{1}{3} \) gives us \( S = \frac{15}{7} \), which is indeed greater than \( \frac{16}{7} \).

Thus, the maximum constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) is:

\[
C = \frac{16}{7}
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C = \frac{16}{7}
\]
