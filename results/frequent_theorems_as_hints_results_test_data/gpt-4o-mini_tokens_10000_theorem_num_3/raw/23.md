Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression 

\[
\frac{a}{1-a} \cdot \frac{b}{1-b} \cdot \frac{c}{1-c}
\]

given the constraint \( a + b + c = 2 \) and \( a, b, c > 0 \). 

First, we can rewrite the terms in the product:

\[
\frac{a}{1-a} = \frac{a}{1 - (b+c)} = \frac{a}{1 - 2 + (a)} = \frac{a}{a - 1 + 1} = \frac{a}{a - 1 + 1} = \frac{a}{1 - (b+c)}.
\]

This suggests that we can express \( \frac{a}{1-a} \) in terms of \( a \) and the other variables \( b \) and \( c \).

Next, we can use the substitution \( x = \frac{a}{1-a} \), \( y = \frac{b}{1-b} \), and \( z = \frac{c}{1-c} \). This gives us:

\[
a = \frac{x}{1+x}, \quad b = \frac{y}{1+y}, \quad c = \frac{z}{1+z}.
\]

Now, we need to express \( a + b + c = 2 \) in terms of \( x, y, z \):

\[
\frac{x}{1+x} + \frac{y}{1+y} + \frac{z}{1+z} = 2.
\]

To find the maximum value of \( C \), we can analyze the product \( xyz \) under the constraint \( a + b + c = 2 \).

Using the method of Lagrange multipliers or by symmetry, we can assume \( a = b = c \) for maximizing the product. Thus, we set \( a = b = c = \frac{2}{3} \).

Calculating \( \frac{a}{1-a} \):

\[
\frac{a}{1-a} = \frac{\frac{2}{3}}{1 - \frac{2}{3}} = \frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{1}{3}} = 2.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{a}{1-a} \cdot \frac{b}{1-b} \cdot \frac{c}{1-c} = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8.
\]

Now, we need to check if this is indeed the minimum value of \( C \). 

To confirm that \( C = 8 \) is the largest constant such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( a + b + c = 2 \), we can apply the AM-GM inequality:

\[
\frac{a}{1-a} + \frac{b}{1-b} + \frac{c}{1-c} \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{abc}{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)}}.
\]

However, since we have already established that the maximum occurs when \( a = b = c = \frac{2}{3} \), we conclude that the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\frac{a}{1-a} \cdot \frac{b}{1-b} \cdot \frac{c}{1-c} \geq C
\]

is indeed \( C = 8 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=8.
\]
