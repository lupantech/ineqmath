Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression \((\sec A - 1)(\sec B - 1)(\sec C - 1)\) for an acute-angled triangle with angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).

### Step 1: Understanding \(\sec A - 1\)

Recall that:
\[
\sec A = \frac{1}{\cos A}
\]
Thus,
\[
\sec A - 1 = \frac{1 - \cos A}{\cos A}
\]
Using the identity \(1 - \cos A = 2 \sin^2\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)\), we can rewrite:
\[
\sec A - 1 = \frac{2 \sin^2\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)}{\cos A}
\]

### Step 2: Analyzing the product

Now, we can express the product:
\[
(\sec A - 1)(\sec B - 1)(\sec C - 1) = \left(\frac{2 \sin^2\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)}{\cos A}\right)\left(\frac{2 \sin^2\left(\frac{B}{2}\right)}{\cos B}\right)\left(\frac{2 \sin^2\left(\frac{C}{2}\right)}{\cos C}\right)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8 \frac{\sin^2\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) \sin^2\left(\frac{B}{2}\right) \sin^2\left(\frac{C}{2}\right)}{\cos A \cos B \cos C}
\]

### Step 3: Establishing bounds

We need to compare this expression to \(1\). To do this, we can use the fact that in an acute triangle, the angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are all less than \(90^\circ\), which implies that \(\cos A\), \(\cos B\), and \(\cos C\) are all positive.

### Step 4: Using known inequalities

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we can derive bounds for the product of the sines and cosines. Specifically, we know that:
\[
\sin A + \sin B + \sin C \leq \frac{3}{2} \quad \text{(for acute angles)}
\]
and
\[
\cos A + \cos B + \cos C \geq \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \quad \text{(for acute angles)}
\]

### Step 5: Analyzing the product

We can also note that:
\[
\sin^2\left(\frac{A}{2}\right) \sin^2\left(\frac{B}{2}\right) \sin^2\left(\frac{C}{2}\right) < 1
\]
because each sine term is less than \(1\) for acute angles.

### Step 6: Conclusion

Given that \((\sec A - 1)(\sec B - 1)(\sec C - 1)\) is a product of positive terms that are less than \(1\) when multiplied together, we conclude that:
\[
(\sec A - 1)(\sec B - 1)(\sec C - 1) < 1
\]

Thus, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:
\[
(\sec A - 1)(\sec B - 1)(\sec C - 1) < 1
\]

### Final Answer

The answer is (D) $<$.
