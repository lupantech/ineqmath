The numbers\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Q M=\\sqrt{\\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \\quad A M=\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\\\\n& G M=\\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{n}} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad H M=\\frac{n}{\\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{a_{n}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nare called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have\n$$\nQ M \\geq A M \\geq G M \\geq H M\n$$\n\nEqualities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\\cdots=a_{n}$.\n\nTheorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have\n$$\n\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\\right)\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\\right) \\geq\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\\right)^{2}\n$$\ni.e.\n$$\n\\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\\right)\\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\\right) \\geq\\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nEquality occurs if and only if the sequences $\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$ and $\\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\\right.$, $\\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\\cdots=\\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.\n\nTheorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \\geq\\left(a_{1} a_{2} \\ldots a_{n}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\n$$\n\nwith equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\\ldots=a_{n}$.

    "response": "To find the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality \n\n\\[\nx^2 + \\frac{1}{6(1 + |x - 2|)} \\geq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all real numbers \\( x \\), we will analyze the expression on the left-hand side.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the term \\( x^2 \\)\n\nThe term \\( x^2 \\) is a parabola that opens upwards, and its minimum value occurs at \\( x = 0 \\), where \\( x^2 = 0 \\). As \\( x \\) moves away from 0, \\( x^2 \\) increases without bound.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the term \\( \\frac{1}{6(1 + |x - 2|)} \\)\n\nThe term \\( |x - 2| \\) represents the distance from \\( x \\) to 2. The minimum value of \\( 1 + |x - 2| \\) occurs when \\( x = 2 \\), giving:\n\n\\[\n1 + |2 - 2| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum value of \\( \\frac{1}{6(1 + |x - 2|)} \\) occurs at \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6(1 + |2 - 2|)} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nAs \\( |x - 2| \\) increases (i.e., as \\( x \\) moves away from 2), \\( \\frac{1}{6(1 + |x - 2|)} \\) decreases towards 0.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the two terms\n\nAt \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 + \\frac{1}{6(1 + |x - 2|)} = 2^2 + \\frac{1}{6} = 4 + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{24}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{25}{6}\n\\]\n\nAs \\( x \\) moves away from 2, \\( x^2 \\) increases and \\( \\frac{1}{6(1 + |x - 2|)} \\) decreases. Therefore, the minimum value of the entire expression occurs at \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the largest constant \\( C \\)\n\nSince the minimum value of \\( x^2 + \\frac{1}{6(1 + |x - 2|)} \\) is \\( \\frac{25}{6} \\), we can conclude that:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + \\frac{1}{6(1 + |x - 2|)} \\geq \\frac{25}{6}\n\\]\n\nfor all \\( x \\). Thus, the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality holds for all real numbers \\( x \\) is:\n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{25}{6}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe answer is \\( C = \\frac{25}{6} \\).",
