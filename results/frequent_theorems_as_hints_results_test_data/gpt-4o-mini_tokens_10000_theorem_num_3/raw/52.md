Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \leq Cn
\]

holds under the condition that \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^3 = 0 \) and \( x_i \in [-1, 1] \) for all \( i \).

### Step 1: Analyze the condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^3 = 0 \)

The condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^3 = 0 \) implies that the positive and negative contributions of \( x_i^3 \) must balance out. Since \( x_i^3 \) is an increasing function for \( x_i \in [-1, 1] \), this means that there must be some \( x_i \) values that are positive and some that are negative.

### Step 2: Use the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to relate the sums of \( x_i \) and \( x_i^3 \):

\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^4 \right) \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^3 \right)^2 = 0.
\]

This implies that \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 = 0 \) or \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^4 = 0 \). Since \( x_i^2 \geq 0 \) and \( x_i^4 \geq 0 \), we conclude that both sums cannot be zero unless all \( x_i \) are zero, which contradicts our requirement to find a non-trivial solution.

### Step 3: Consider the bounds of \( x_i \)

Since \( x_i \in [-1, 1] \), we can analyze the maximum possible value of \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \). The maximum occurs when we have the most positive contributions balanced by negative contributions.

### Step 4: Construct a specific case

Letâ€™s consider a case where we have \( k \) values of \( x_i = 1 \) and \( m \) values of \( x_i = -1 \) such that \( k + m = n \) and \( k - m = 0 \) (to satisfy \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^3 = 0 \)). This gives us \( k = m = \frac{n}{2} \) (assuming \( n \) is even).

In this case, we have:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = k \cdot 1 + m \cdot (-1) = \frac{n}{2} - \frac{n}{2} = 0.
\]

### Step 5: Generalize the result

Now, if we consider the case where we have \( k \) values of \( x_i = 1 \) and \( n-k \) values of \( x_i = -1 \) such that \( k^3 + (n-k)(-1)^3 = 0 \), we find that:

\[
k^3 - (n-k) = 0 \implies k^3 = n - k \implies k^3 + k = n.
\]

This gives us a cubic equation in \( k \). However, we can also see that the maximum value of \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) is bounded by \( n \) when all \( x_i \) are equal to \( 1 \) or \( -1 \).

### Step 6: Conclusion

The maximum value of \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) under the given constraints is \( 0 \). Therefore, the smallest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \leq Cn
\]

is \( C = 0 \).

Thus, the answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=0.
\]
