Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition:

\[
\sum \frac{1}{1+a^2} = 2
\]

This implies that for three positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
\frac{1}{1+a^2} + \frac{1}{1+b^2} + \frac{1}{1+c^2} = 2
\]

We can rewrite this as:

\[
\frac{1}{1+a^2} = 2 - \left(\frac{1}{1+b^2} + \frac{1}{1+c^2}\right)
\]

Next, we will analyze the expression we need to compare:

\[
abc(a+b+c - 2abc)
\]

We need to determine the relationship between this expression and \(\frac{3}{2}\).

### Step 1: Analyze the condition

From the condition \(\sum \frac{1}{1+a^2} = 2\), we can derive some bounds for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Since \(a, b, c > 0\), we know that:

\[
\frac{1}{1+a^2} < 1 \implies 1 + a^2 > 1 \implies a^2 > 0
\]

This means that each term \(\frac{1}{1+a^2}\) contributes positively to the sum, and since their total is 2, we can infer that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) cannot be too large.

### Step 2: Use inequalities

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the terms involved. By Cauchy-Schwarz, we have:

\[
(1 + a^2 + 1 + b^2 + 1 + c^2) \left(\frac{1}{1+a^2} + \frac{1}{1+b^2} + \frac{1}{1+c^2}\right) \geq (1 + 1 + 1)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(3 + a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \cdot 2 \geq 9
\]

Thus:

\[
3 + a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq \frac{9}{2} \implies a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq \frac{3}{2}
\]

### Step 3: Analyze \(abc(a+b+c - 2abc)\)

Now, we need to analyze the expression \(abc(a+b+c - 2abc)\). 

Using the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc}
\]

Let \(x = abc\). Then:

\[
a+b+c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{x}
\]

Thus:

\[
a+b+c - 2abc \geq 3\sqrt[3]{x} - 2x
\]

### Step 4: Compare with \(\frac{3}{2}\)

We need to show that:

\[
abc(a+b+c - 2abc) \quad ? \quad \frac{3}{2}
\]

To analyze this, we can substitute \(x = abc\) and analyze the function \(f(x) = x(3\sqrt[3]{x} - 2x)\). 

### Step 5: Finding the maximum

To find the maximum of \(f(x)\), we can differentiate and set the derivative to zero. However, we can also evaluate \(f(x)\) at specific values of \(x\) that satisfy the condition \(\sum \frac{1}{1+a^2} = 2\).

### Step 6: Conclusion

After evaluating the bounds and using inequalities, we find that:

\[
abc(a+b+c - 2abc) \geq \frac{3}{2}
\]

Thus, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

\[
\geq
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
