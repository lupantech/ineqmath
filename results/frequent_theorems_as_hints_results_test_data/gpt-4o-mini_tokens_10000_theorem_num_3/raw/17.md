Problem: Let $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ such that $a + b + c = 1$. Determine the minimal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$:

$$

$$

Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality 

\[
\frac{a}{a+bc} + \frac{b}{b+ac} + \frac{\sqrt{abc}}{c+ab} \leq C
\]

for positive real numbers \(a, b, c\) such that \(a + b + c = 1\). We will find the minimal constant \(C\) that satisfies this inequality for all valid \(a, b, c\).

### Step 1: Analyze Each Term

1. **First Term**: 
   \[
   \frac{a}{a + bc}
   \]
   Since \(bc \geq 0\), we have \(a + bc \geq a\). Thus,
   \[
   \frac{a}{a + bc} \leq 1.
   \]

2. **Second Term**: 
   \[
   \frac{b}{b + ac}
   \]
   Similarly, since \(ac \geq 0\), we have \(b + ac \geq b\). Thus,
   \[
   \frac{b}{b + ac} \leq 1.
   \]

3. **Third Term**: 
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{abc}}{c + ab}
   \]
   Here, we note that \(c + ab \geq c\) since \(ab \geq 0\). Thus,
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{abc}}{c + ab} \leq \frac{\sqrt{abc}}{c}.
   \]

### Step 2: Bound the Third Term

To bound \(\frac{\sqrt{abc}}{c}\), we can use the AM-GM inequality. Since \(a + b + c = 1\), we can apply AM-GM to \(a, b, c\):

\[
\frac{a + b + c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies \frac{1}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies abc \leq \frac{1}{27}.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\sqrt{abc} \leq \sqrt{\frac{1}{27}} = \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}.
\]

### Step 3: Combine the Terms

Now we can combine our findings:

\[
\frac{a}{a + bc} + \frac{b}{b + ac} + \frac{\sqrt{abc}}{c + ab} \leq 1 + 1 + \frac{\sqrt{abc}}{c}.
\]

To find a bound for \(\frac{\sqrt{abc}}{c}\), we note that since \(c \leq 1\), we have:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{abc}}{c} \leq \sqrt{abc} \leq \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}.
\]

### Step 4: Find the Maximum Value of the Sum

Now we need to find the maximum value of the sum:

\[
\frac{a}{a + bc} + \frac{b}{b + ac} + \frac{\sqrt{abc}}{c + ab} \leq 2 + \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Constant \(C\)

To find \(C\), we need to evaluate:

\[
C = 2 + \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}.
\]

Calculating \(C\):

1. The numerical value of \(\frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}} \approx 0.19245\).
2. Thus, \(C \approx 2 + 0.19245 = 2.19245\).

### Conclusion

The minimal constant \(C\) such that the inequality holds for all positive \(a, b, c\) with \(a + b + c = 1\) is:

\[
C = 2 + \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}.
\]

Thus, the answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C = 2 + \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}.
\]
