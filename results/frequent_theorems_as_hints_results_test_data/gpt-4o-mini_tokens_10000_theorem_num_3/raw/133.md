Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\frac{1}{1-x} + \frac{1}{1-y} + \frac{1}{1-z} \quad () \quad \left(1 + \frac{x+y+z}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1-xy} + \frac{1}{1-yz} + \frac{1}{1-zx}\right),
\]

we will analyze both sides of the inequality step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Left Side

The left side is 

\[
L = \frac{1}{1-x} + \frac{1}{1-y} + \frac{1}{1-z}.
\]

Since \(x, y, z \in [0, 1)\), each term \(\frac{1}{1-a}\) (where \(a\) is \(x\), \(y\), or \(z\)) is positive and increases as \(a\) approaches 1. 

### Step 2: Analyze the Right Side

The right side is 

\[
R = \left(1 + \frac{x+y+z}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1-xy} + \frac{1}{1-yz} + \frac{1}{1-zx}\right).
\]

1. **First Factor**: The term \(1 + \frac{x+y+z}{3}\) is also positive and less than or equal to 1, since \(x, y, z < 1\).

2. **Second Factor**: Each term \(\frac{1}{1-ab}\) (where \(ab\) is \(xy\), \(yz\), or \(zx\)) is also positive and increases as \(ab\) approaches 1. 

### Step 3: Use Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

To compare \(L\) and \(R\), we can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 

Using Cauchy-Schwarz on the left side:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{1-x} + \frac{1}{1-y} + \frac{1}{1-z}\right) \left((1-x) + (1-y) + (1-z)\right) \geq (1 + 1 + 1)^2 = 9.
\]

This gives us:

\[
L \cdot (3 - (x+y+z)) \geq 9 \implies L \geq \frac{9}{3 - (x+y+z)}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the Right Side Further

Now, we need to analyze the right side \(R\):

\[
R = \left(1 + \frac{x+y+z}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1-xy} + \frac{1}{1-yz} + \frac{1}{1-zx}\right).
\]

Using the fact that \(1 - ab \leq 1\) for \(a, b < 1\), we can see that:

\[
\frac{1}{1-xy} + \frac{1}{1-yz} + \frac{1}{1-zx} \geq 3,
\]

by applying the AM-HM inequality (since \(1-xy, 1-yz, 1-zx < 1\)).

Thus, we have:

\[
R \geq \left(1 + \frac{x+y+z}{3}\right) \cdot 3 = 3 + (x+y+z).
\]

### Step 5: Compare \(L\) and \(R\)

Now we need to compare \(L\) and \(R\):

1. From Cauchy-Schwarz, we have \(L \geq \frac{9}{3 - (x+y+z)}\).
2. From our analysis of \(R\), we have \(R \geq 3 + (x+y+z)\).

### Conclusion

To determine the relationship between \(L\) and \(R\), we can see that as \(x, y, z\) approach 1, \(L\) tends to infinity, while \(R\) remains bounded. Thus, we can conclude that:

\[
L \geq R.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

\[
\text{The answer is (B) } \geq.
\]
