Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition:

\[
|x + 2y + 3z| = 1.
\]

We need to analyze the expression:

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + \left|x^2 + y^2 + z^2\right|.
\]

Let \( S = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \). The expression we are interested in becomes:

\[
S + |S|.
\]

Now, we can consider two cases for \( S \):

1. **Case 1**: \( S \geq 0 \)

In this case, we have:

\[
S + |S| = S + S = 2S.
\]

2. **Case 2**: \( S < 0 \)

In this case, we have:

\[
S + |S| = S - S = 0.
\]

Next, we need to find a bound for \( S \). We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to relate \( S \) to the given condition \( |x + 2y + 3z| = 1 \).

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
|x + 2y + 3z|^2 \leq (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2)(|x|^2 + |y|^2 + |z|^2).
\]

Calculating the left-hand side:

\[
|x + 2y + 3z|^2 = 1^2 = 1.
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
1 \leq 14(|x|^2 + |y|^2 + |z|^2).
\]

This implies:

\[
|x|^2 + |y|^2 + |z|^2 \geq \frac{1}{14}.
\]

Now, since \( S = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) (where \( x, y, z \) are complex numbers), we can write:

\[
|S| = |x^2 + y^2 + z^2| \leq |x|^2 + |y|^2 + |z|^2.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
|S| \geq \frac{1}{14}.
\]

Now, we can analyze \( S \):

- If \( S \geq 0 \), then \( 2S \geq 2 \cdot \frac{1}{14} = \frac{1}{7} \).
- If \( S < 0 \), then \( S + |S| = 0 \).

In both cases, we can conclude that:

\[
S + |S| \geq 0.
\]

Now, we need to compare \( S + |S| \) with \( \frac{1}{8} \):

- From the case where \( S \geq 0 \), we have \( 2S \geq \frac{1}{7} \), which is greater than \( \frac{1}{8} \).
- From the case where \( S < 0 \), we have \( S + |S| = 0 \), which is also greater than \( \frac{1}{8} \).

Thus, we can conclude that:

\[
S + |S| \geq \frac{1}{8}.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

\[
\geq.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
