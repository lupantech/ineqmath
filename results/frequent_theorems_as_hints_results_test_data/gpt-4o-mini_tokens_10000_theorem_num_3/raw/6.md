Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
a + \frac{1}{b(a-b)} \geq C
\]

holds for all non-negative real numbers \( a \) and \( b \) with \( a \geq b \geq 0 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the expression

We can rewrite the inequality as:

\[
\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \geq C - a.
\]

This implies that we need to analyze the behavior of \( \frac{1}{b(a-b)} \) as \( a \) and \( b \) vary.

### Step 2: Consider the case when \( b \) approaches 0

If \( b = 0 \), the term \( \frac{1}{b(a-b)} \) becomes undefined. Therefore, we need to consider the limit as \( b \) approaches 0. 

Let \( b \) be a small positive number. Then, as \( b \to 0 \):

\[
\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \to \infty.
\]

This means that for any fixed \( a \), as \( b \) approaches 0, the left-hand side of the inequality can become arbitrarily large. Thus, we cannot determine \( C \) from this case.

### Step 3: Consider the case when \( a = b \)

Now, let’s consider the case when \( a = b \). In this case, we have:

\[
a + \frac{1}{b(a-b)} = a + \frac{1}{b(0)}.
\]

This is again undefined. Therefore, we need to consider \( a > b \).

### Step 4: Consider \( a = b + \epsilon \) for small \( \epsilon > 0 \)

Let \( a = b + \epsilon \) where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then we have:

\[
a - b = \epsilon,
\]

and the inequality becomes:

\[
(b + \epsilon) + \frac{1}{b \epsilon} \geq C.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the limit as \( \epsilon \to 0 \)

As \( \epsilon \to 0 \), the term \( \frac{1}{b \epsilon} \) dominates. Thus, we can analyze the limit:

\[
\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( b + \epsilon + \frac{1}{b \epsilon} \right).
\]

For fixed \( b > 0 \), as \( \epsilon \to 0 \):

\[
\frac{1}{b \epsilon} \to \infty.
\]

This means that the left-hand side can also become arbitrarily large.

### Step 6: Find a lower bound for \( C \)

To find a lower bound for \( C \), we can consider specific values of \( a \) and \( b \). 

Let’s set \( b = 1 \) and \( a = 1 \):

\[
1 + \frac{1}{1(1-1)} \text{ is undefined.}
\]

Now let’s try \( b = 1 \) and \( a = 2 \):

\[
2 + \frac{1}{1(2-1)} = 2 + 1 = 3.
\]

Next, let’s try \( b = 2 \) and \( a = 3 \):

\[
3 + \frac{1}{2(3-2)} = 3 + \frac{1}{2} = 3.5.
\]

### Step 7: General case

To find the largest constant \( C \), we can see that as \( b \) increases, the term \( \frac{1}{b(a-b)} \) decreases. Therefore, we can conclude that the minimum value of \( a + \frac{1}{b(a-b)} \) occurs when \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, which leads to undefined behavior.

However, we can see that the minimum value we can achieve is when \( a \) is just slightly greater than \( b \). 

### Conclusion

After testing various values, we find that the minimum value of \( a + \frac{1}{b(a-b)} \) approaches 3 as \( b \) approaches 1 and \( a \) approaches 2. Thus, the largest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all \( a \geq b \geq 0 \) is:

\[
C = 3.
\]

Thus, the answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=3.
\]
