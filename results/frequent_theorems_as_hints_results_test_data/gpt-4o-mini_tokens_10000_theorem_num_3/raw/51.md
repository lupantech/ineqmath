Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) \geq C
\]

holds under the conditions:

1. \( a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n \geq n \)
2. \( a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2 \geq n^2 \)

### Step 1: Analyze the conditions

From the first condition, we can deduce that the average of the numbers \( a_i \) is at least 1:

\[
\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n} \geq 1
\]

From the second condition, we can deduce that the quadratic mean of the numbers \( a_i \) is at least 1:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2}{n}} \geq 1
\]

### Step 2: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2)(1 + 1 + \cdots + 1) \geq (a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
n(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2) \geq (a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)^2
\]

Substituting the conditions, we get:

\[
n \cdot n^2 \geq n^2 \implies n^3 \geq n^2
\]

This is trivially true for \( n \geq 1 \).

### Step 3: Use the inequalities to find bounds on \( \max(a_i) \)

Let \( M = \max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) \). Since \( M \) is the maximum, we have:

\[
M \geq a_i \quad \text{for all } i
\]

Thus, we can express the sum of the \( a_i \) in terms of \( M \):

\[
a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n \leq nM
\]

From the first condition \( a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n \geq n \), we have:

\[
nM \geq n \implies M \geq 1
\]

### Step 4: Check if \( C = 1 \) is the largest possible value

Now we need to check if \( C = 1 \) is indeed the largest constant that satisfies the conditions. 

Assume \( a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_n = 1 \). Then:

- \( a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = n \geq n \) (satisfied)
- \( a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2 = n \geq n^2 \) (not satisfied unless \( n = 1 \))

Now consider \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = a_3 = \cdots = a_n = 0 \) for \( n > 1 \):

- \( a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 1 \geq n \) (not satisfied)

Thus, we can conclude that the maximum value of \( C \) that satisfies both conditions is indeed \( C = 1 \).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the conditions and applying the necessary inequalities, we find that the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) \geq C
\]

is satisfied under the given constraints is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=1.
