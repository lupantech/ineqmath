Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\left(x^2 - yz\right)^2 \quad () \quad \frac{27}{8}\left(xz - y^2\right)\left(xy - z^2\right),
\]

we will analyze both sides of the inequality and apply relevant inequalities.

### Step 1: Analyze the left-hand side

The left-hand side is 

\[
\left(x^2 - yz\right)^2.
\]

This expression is always non-negative since it is a square.

### Step 2: Analyze the right-hand side

The right-hand side is 

\[
\frac{27}{8}\left(xz - y^2\right)\left(xy - z^2\right).
\]

We need to determine when this expression is non-negative. The product \((xz - y^2)(xy - z^2)\) will be non-negative if both factors are either both non-negative or both non-positive.

### Step 3: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the terms involved. Consider the following:

1. **Cauchy-Schwarz on \(x^2, yz\)**:
   \[
   (x^2 + yz)(1 + 1) \geq (x - \sqrt{yz})^2.
   \]
   This does not directly help us, but it shows that \(x^2\) can be compared to \(yz\).

2. **Cauchy-Schwarz on \(xz, y^2\)** and \(xy, z^2\)**:
   \[
   (xz + y^2)(xy + z^2) \geq (x\sqrt{y^2} + y\sqrt{z^2})^2 = (xy + yz)^2.
   \]

### Step 4: Consider specific cases

To understand the inequality better, we can consider specific cases for \(x, y, z\). 

1. **Case 1**: Let \(x = y = z = 1\):
   \[
   \left(1^2 - 1 \cdot 1\right)^2 = 0,
   \]
   and
   \[
   \frac{27}{8}(1 \cdot 1 - 1^2)(1 \cdot 1 - 1^2) = \frac{27}{8}(0)(0) = 0.
   \]
   Here, both sides are equal.

2. **Case 2**: Let \(x = 2, y = 1, z = 1\):
   \[
   \left(2^2 - 1 \cdot 1\right)^2 = (4 - 1)^2 = 3^2 = 9,
   \]
   and
   \[
   \frac{27}{8}(2 \cdot 1 - 1^2)(2 \cdot 1 - 1^2) = \frac{27}{8}(2 - 1)(2 - 1) = \frac{27}{8}(1)(1) = \frac{27}{8} = 3.375.
   \]
   Here, \(9 > 3.375\).

3. **Case 3**: Let \(x = 1, y = 1, z = 2\):
   \[
   \left(1^2 - 1 \cdot 2\right)^2 = (1 - 2)^2 = 1,
   \]
   and
   \[
   \frac{27}{8}(1 \cdot 2 - 1^2)(1 \cdot 1 - 2^2) = \frac{27}{8}(2 - 1)(1 - 4) = \frac{27}{8}(1)(-3) = -\frac{27}{8}.
   \]
   Here, \(1 > -\frac{27}{8}\).

### Conclusion

From the analysis and specific cases, we see that the left-hand side can be greater than the right-hand side in certain cases, and they can also be equal in specific cases. However, the left-hand side is always non-negative, while the right-hand side can be negative.

Thus, we conclude that the correct inequality is:

\[
\left(x^2 - yz\right)^2 \geq \frac{27}{8}\left(xz - y^2\right)\left(xy - z^2\right).
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
