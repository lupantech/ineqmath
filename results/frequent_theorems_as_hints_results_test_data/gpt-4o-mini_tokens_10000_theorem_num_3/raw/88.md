$$

Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality 

\[
\frac{1}{1+a^2} + \frac{6}{5(1+b^2)} + \frac{1}{1+c^2} \geq C
\]

given the constraint \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1 \) with \( a, b, c \geq 0 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the terms

We will analyze each term in the left-hand side of the inequality separately.

1. **For \( \frac{1}{1+a^2} \)**:
   - The function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{1+x} \) is decreasing. Therefore, as \( a^2 \) increases, \( \frac{1}{1+a^2} \) decreases.

2. **For \( \frac{6}{5(1+b^2)} \)**:
   - Similarly, \( g(y) = \frac{6}{5(1+y)} \) is also decreasing. Thus, as \( b^2 \) increases, \( \frac{6}{5(1+b^2)} \) decreases.

3. **For \( \frac{1}{1+c^2} \)**:
   - The function \( h(z) = \frac{1}{1+z} \) is decreasing as well. Hence, as \( c^2 \) increases, \( \frac{1}{1+c^2} \) decreases.

### Step 2: Use the constraint

Given the constraint \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1 \), we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and \( c \):

\[
b = 1 - a^2 - c^2
\]

### Step 3: Find bounds for \( b^2 \)

Since \( b \geq 0 \), we have:

\[
1 - a^2 - c^2 \geq 0 \implies a^2 + c^2 \leq 1
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the left-hand side

To find the minimum value of the left-hand side, we will consider specific cases for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

#### Case 1: \( a = 0, c = 0 \)

Then \( b = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{1+0^2} + \frac{6}{5(1+1^2)} + \frac{1}{1+0^2} = 1 + \frac{6}{10} + 1 = 1 + 0.6 + 1 = 2.6
\]

#### Case 2: \( a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 \)

Then \( b = 0 \):

\[
\frac{1}{1+1^2} + \frac{6}{5(1+0^2)} + \frac{1}{1+0^2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{6}{5} + 1 = 0.5 + 1.2 + 1 = 2.7
\]

#### Case 3: \( a = 0, b = 1, c = 0 \)

Then \( a = 0 \) and \( c = 0 \):

\[
\frac{1}{1+0^2} + \frac{6}{5(1+1^2)} + \frac{1}{1+0^2} = 1 + \frac{6}{10} + 1 = 2.6
\]

#### Case 4: \( a = 0, b = 0, c = 1 \)

Then \( a = 0 \) and \( b = 0 \):

\[
\frac{1}{1+0^2} + \frac{6}{5(1+0^2)} + \frac{1}{1+1^2} = 1 + \frac{6}{5} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 + 1.2 + 0.5 = 2.7
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion

From the evaluations, the minimum value of the left-hand side occurs at \( a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 \) or \( a = 0, b = 0, c = 1 \), yielding a minimum of \( 2.7 \).

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all non-negative \( a, b, c \) satisfying the constraint is:

\[
C = 2.7
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=2.7
\]
