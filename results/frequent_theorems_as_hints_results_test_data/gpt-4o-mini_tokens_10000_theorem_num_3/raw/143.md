Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\sqrt{a^2 x^2 + b^2 y^2} + \sqrt{a^2 y^2 + b^2 x^2} \quad () \quad a + b,
\]

given that \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\), we will apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

### Step 1: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we can analyze each term in the left-hand side:

1. For the first term \(\sqrt{a^2 x^2 + b^2 y^2}\):
   \[
   \sqrt{a^2 x^2 + b^2 y^2} \leq \sqrt{(x^2 + y^2)(a^2 + b^2)} = \sqrt{1 \cdot (a^2 + b^2)} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
   \]

2. For the second term \(\sqrt{a^2 y^2 + b^2 x^2}\):
   \[
   \sqrt{a^2 y^2 + b^2 x^2} \leq \sqrt{(y^2 + x^2)(a^2 + b^2)} = \sqrt{1 \cdot (a^2 + b^2)} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
   \]

### Step 2: Combine the Results

Adding these two inequalities gives:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 x^2 + b^2 y^2} + \sqrt{a^2 y^2 + b^2 x^2} \leq \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 2\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare with \(a + b\)

Now we need to compare \(2\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\) with \(a + b\). 

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again, we have:
\[
(a + b)^2 \leq 2(a^2 + b^2).
\]
Taking the square root of both sides (noting that both sides are non-negative), we get:
\[
a + b \leq \sqrt{2(a^2 + b^2)}.
\]

### Step 4: Final Comparison

Thus, we can conclude:
\[
2\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \geq a + b.
\]

This implies:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 x^2 + b^2 y^2} + \sqrt{a^2 y^2 + b^2 x^2} \leq 2\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \geq a + b.
\]

### Conclusion

Therefore, we have established that:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 x^2 + b^2 y^2} + \sqrt{a^2 y^2 + b^2 x^2} \leq a + b.
\]

Thus, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (A) $\leq$.
