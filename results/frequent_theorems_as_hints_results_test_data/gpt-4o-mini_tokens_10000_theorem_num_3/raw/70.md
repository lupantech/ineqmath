Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{x^2 y}{z} + \frac{y^2 z}{x} + \frac{z^2 x}{y} \geq C(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
\]

holds for all non-negative \( x, y, z \) with \( x \geq y \geq z \geq 0 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the inequality

We can rewrite the inequality as:

\[
\frac{x^2 y}{z} + \frac{y^2 z}{x} + \frac{z^2 x}{y} - C(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \geq 0.
\]

### Step 2: Test specific cases

To find the largest \( C \), we can test specific cases of \( x, y, z \).

#### Case 1: \( x = y = z = 1 \)

Substituting \( x = y = z = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1^2 \cdot 1}{1} + \frac{1^2 \cdot 1}{1} + \frac{1^2 \cdot 1}{1} = 3.
\]
The right-hand side becomes:

\[
C(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) = 3C.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
3 \geq 3C \implies C \leq 1.
\]

#### Case 2: \( x = 1, y = 1, z = 0 \)

Substituting \( x = 1, y = 1, z = 0 \):

\[
\frac{1^2 \cdot 1}{0} + \frac{1^2 \cdot 0}{1} + \frac{0^2 \cdot 1}{1} \text{ is undefined.}
\]

This case is not valid since \( z = 0 \) leads to division by zero.

#### Case 3: \( x = 1, y = 0, z = 0 \)

Substituting \( x = 1, y = 0, z = 0 \):

\[
\frac{1^2 \cdot 0}{0} + \frac{0^2 \cdot 0}{1} + \frac{0^2 \cdot 1}{0} \text{ is also undefined.}
\]

#### Case 4: \( x = 2, y = 1, z = 0 \)

Substituting \( x = 2, y = 1, z = 0 \):

\[
\frac{2^2 \cdot 1}{0} + \frac{1^2 \cdot 0}{2} + \frac{0^2 \cdot 2}{1} \text{ is undefined.}
\]

### Step 3: General case with \( z \to 0 \)

Let \( z \to 0 \) while keeping \( x \) and \( y \) fixed. The left-hand side becomes:

\[
\frac{x^2 y}{0} + \frac{y^2 \cdot 0}{x} + \frac{0^2 x}{y} \to \infty.
\]

The right-hand side becomes:

\[
C(x^2 + y^2 + 0) = C(x^2 + y^2).
\]

This suggests that the inequality holds for any finite \( C \) as \( z \to 0 \).

### Step 4: Use Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the left-hand side:

\[
\left( \frac{x^2 y}{z} + \frac{y^2 z}{x} + \frac{z^2 x}{y} \right) \left( z + x + y \right) \geq (xy + yz + zx)^2.
\]

This gives us a way to relate the left-hand side to the right-hand side.

### Step 5: Conclusion

After testing various cases and analyzing the behavior of the inequality, we find that the largest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all non-negative \( x, y, z \) is:

\[
C = 1.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=1.
\]
