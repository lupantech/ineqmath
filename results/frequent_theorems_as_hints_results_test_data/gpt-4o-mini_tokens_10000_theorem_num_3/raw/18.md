Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\sin^{2m} x \cdot \cos^{2n} y \leq C \frac{3m^n n^n}{(m+n)^{m+n}}
\]

holds for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step 1: Analyze the left-hand side

The left-hand side of the inequality is \( \sin^{2m} x \cdot \cos^{2n} y \). We know that both \( \sin^2 x \) and \( \cos^2 y \) are bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, we can denote:

\[
a = \sin^2 x \quad \text{and} \quad b = \cos^2 y
\]

This gives us:

\[
\sin^{2m} x \cdot \cos^{2n} y = a^m b^n
\]

### Step 2: Apply the AM-GM Inequality

Using the AM-GM inequality, we can find a bound for \( a^m b^n \):

\[
\frac{m \cdot a + n \cdot b}{m+n} \geq (a^m b^n)^{\frac{1}{m+n}}
\]

Raising both sides to the power of \( m+n \):

\[
\left(\frac{m \cdot a + n \cdot b}{m+n}\right)^{m+n} \geq a^m b^n
\]

### Step 3: Find the maximum of \( a \) and \( b \)

Since \( a = \sin^2 x \) and \( b = \cos^2 y \), we know that \( a + b = \sin^2 x + \cos^2 y \) can take values between 0 and 1. The maximum value of \( a^m b^n \) occurs when \( a \) and \( b \) are balanced according to the weights \( m \) and \( n \).

### Step 4: Set \( a = \frac{m}{m+n} \) and \( b = \frac{n}{m+n} \)

To maximize \( a^m b^n \), we set:

\[
a = \frac{m}{m+n}, \quad b = \frac{n}{m+n}
\]

Then we have:

\[
a^m = \left(\frac{m}{m+n}\right)^m, \quad b^n = \left(\frac{n}{m+n}\right)^n
\]

Thus,

\[
a^m b^n = \left(\frac{m}{m+n}\right)^m \left(\frac{n}{m+n}\right)^n = \frac{m^m n^n}{(m+n)^{m+n}}
\]

### Step 5: Substitute back into the inequality

Now we substitute this back into our inequality:

\[
\frac{m^m n^n}{(m+n)^{m+n}} \leq C \frac{3m^n n^n}{(m+n)^{m+n}}
\]

Dividing both sides by \( \frac{m^m n^n}{(m+n)^{m+n}} \):

\[
1 \leq C \cdot 3 \cdot \frac{m^n}{m^m}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
C \geq \frac{(m+n)^{m+n}}{3m^n n^n}
\]

### Step 6: Find the smallest constant \( C \)

To find the smallest constant \( C \), we can analyze the case when \( m = n \):

Let \( m = n = k \):

\[
C \geq \frac{(2k)^{2k}}{3k^k k^k} = \frac{(2k)^{2k}}{3k^{2k}} = \frac{4^k}{3}
\]

As \( k \) approaches infinity, the minimum value of \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all \( m \) and \( n \) is \( \frac{4}{3} \).

### Conclusion

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all natural numbers \( m \) and \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{C = 1}
\]

The answer is \( C=1 \).
