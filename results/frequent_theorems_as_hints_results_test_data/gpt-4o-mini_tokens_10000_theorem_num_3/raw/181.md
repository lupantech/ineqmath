Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given quadrilateral \(ABCD\) where \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AC \perp BD\). 

1. **Understanding the Geometry**:
   - Since \(AB \parallel CD\), we can consider \(AB\) and \(CD\) as the bases of a trapezoid.
   - The condition \(AC \perp BD\) indicates that the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at a right angle.

2. **Using the Properties of Trapezoids**:
   - In a trapezoid, the sum of the lengths of the legs (the non-parallel sides) is greater than or equal to the sum of the lengths of the bases, plus the height of the trapezoid. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     AD + BC \geq AB + CD + h
     \]
   where \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid from base \(AB\) to base \(CD\).

3. **Height Consideration**:
   - The height \(h\) is a positive quantity since it represents the perpendicular distance between the two parallel lines \(AB\) and \(CD\). Therefore, we can conclude:
     \[
     AD + BC \geq AB + CD + 1
     \]
   because \(h\) is at least 1 (as we can assume the height is at least 1 unit for the sake of this inequality).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - From the above reasoning, we can fill in the blank in the inequality:
     \[
     AD + BC \geq AB + CD + 1
     \]
   Thus, the correct relation to fill in the blank is \(\geq\).

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\text{The answer is (B) } \geq
\]
