Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
x^5 + y^5 + z^5 - 2x^4 y - 2y^4 z - z^4 x \quad () \quad 1,
\]

we will analyze the expression \( E = x^5 + y^5 + z^5 - 2x^4 y - 2y^4 z - z^4 x \).

### Step 1: Analyze the expression

We can rewrite the expression \( E \) as follows:

\[
E = x^5 - 2x^4 y + y^5 - 2y^4 z + z^5 - z^4 x.
\]

### Step 2: Factor the terms

We can factor the first two terms:

\[
x^5 - 2x^4 y = x^4(x - 2y).
\]

Similarly, we can factor the second pair:

\[
y^5 - 2y^4 z = y^4(y - 2z).
\]

And for the last term, we have:

\[
z^5 - z^4 x = z^4(z - x).
\]

Thus, we can express \( E \) as:

\[
E = x^4(x - 2y) + y^4(y - 2z) + z^4(z - x).
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the signs of the terms

Now, we will analyze the signs of each term in \( E \):

1. **For \( x^4(x - 2y) \)**:
   - If \( x \geq 2y \), then \( x - 2y \geq 0 \) and \( E \) is non-negative.
   - If \( x < 2y \), then \( x - 2y < 0 \) and this term contributes negatively.

2. **For \( y^4(y - 2z) \)**:
   - If \( y \geq 2z \), then \( y - 2z \geq 0 \) and this term is non-negative.
   - If \( y < 2z \), then \( y - 2z < 0 \) and this term contributes negatively.

3. **For \( z^4(z - x) \)**:
   - If \( z \geq x \), then \( z - x \geq 0 \) and this term is non-negative.
   - If \( z < x \), then \( z - x < 0 \) and this term contributes negatively.

### Step 4: Consider the bounds

Since \( x, y, z \in [0, 1] \), we can analyze the maximum and minimum values of \( E \):

- The maximum value of \( x^5, y^5, z^5 \) is \( 1 \) when \( x, y, z = 1 \).
- The minimum value of \( -2x^4y, -2y^4z, -z^4x \) is \( -2 \) when \( x, y, z = 1 \).

### Step 5: Evaluate specific cases

1. **Case \( x = y = z = 1 \)**:
   \[
   E = 1^5 + 1^5 + 1^5 - 2(1^4)(1) - 2(1^4)(1) - (1^4)(1) = 3 - 2 - 2 - 1 = -2.
   \]

2. **Case \( x = y = z = 0 \)**:
   \[
   E = 0^5 + 0^5 + 0^5 - 2(0^4)(0) - 2(0^4)(0) - (0^4)(0) = 0.
   \]

3. **Case \( x = 1, y = 0, z = 0 \)**:
   \[
   E = 1^5 + 0^5 + 0^5 - 2(1^4)(0) - 2(0^4)(0) - (0^4)(1) = 1.
   \]

### Conclusion

From the analysis, we see that \( E \) can take values less than or equal to \( 1 \) but never exceeds \( 1 \). Therefore, we conclude that:

\[
E \leq 1.
\]

Thus, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (A) $\leq$.
