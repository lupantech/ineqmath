Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\sqrt{x(y+1)} + \sqrt{y(z+1)} + \sqrt{z(x+1)} \quad () \quad 2 \sqrt{(x+1)(y+1)(z+1)},
\]

we will apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

### Step 1: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we can express the left-hand side as follows:

\[
\left( \sqrt{x(y+1)} + \sqrt{y(z+1)} + \sqrt{z(x+1)} \right)^2 \leq (1 + 1 + 1) \left( x(y+1) + y(z+1) + z(x+1) \right).
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\left( \sqrt{x(y+1)} + \sqrt{y(z+1)} + \sqrt{z(x+1)} \right)^2 \leq 3 \left( x(y+1) + y(z+1) + z(x+1) \right).
\]

### Step 2: Expand the Right-Hand Side

Now, we expand \( x(y+1) + y(z+1) + z(x+1) \):

\[
x(y+1) + y(z+1) + z(x+1) = xy + x + yz + y + zx + z = xy + yz + zx + (x + y + z).
\]

### Step 3: Relate to the Right-Hand Side

Next, we need to relate this to the right-hand side \( 2\sqrt{(x+1)(y+1)(z+1)} \). We can expand \( (x+1)(y+1)(z+1) \):

\[
(x+1)(y+1)(z+1) = xyz + xy + xz + yz + x + y + z + 1.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
2\sqrt{(x+1)(y+1)(z+1)} = 2\sqrt{xyz + xy + xz + yz + x + y + z + 1}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare Both Sides

Now we need to compare:

\[
\sqrt{x(y+1)} + \sqrt{y(z+1)} + \sqrt{z(x+1)} \quad \text{and} \quad 2\sqrt{(x+1)(y+1)(z+1)}.
\]

From the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
\left( \sqrt{x(y+1)} + \sqrt{y(z+1)} + \sqrt{z(x+1)} \right)^2 \leq 3 \left( xy + yz + zx + (x + y + z) \right).
\]

### Step 5: Establish the Final Inequality

To establish the inequality, we need to show that:

\[
3(xy + yz + zx + (x + y + z)) \leq 4(xy + xz + yz + x + y + z + 1).
\]

This can be simplified and rearranged, but intuitively, we can see that the left-hand side is less than or equal to the right-hand side due to the nature of the terms involved.

### Conclusion

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
\sqrt{x(y+1)} + \sqrt{y(z+1)} + \sqrt{z(x+1)} \leq 2\sqrt{(x+1)(y+1)(z+1)}.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (A) $\leq$.
