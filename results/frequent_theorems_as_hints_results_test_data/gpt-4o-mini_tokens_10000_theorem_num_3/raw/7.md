Problem: Let $0 < a < b$ and $x_i \in [a, b]$. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x_i$:

Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression 

\[
\left(x_1+x_2+\ldots+x_n\right)\left(\frac{1}{x_1}+\frac{1}{x_2}+\ldots+\frac{1}{x_n}\right)
\]

and find the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\left(x_1+x_2+\ldots+x_n\right)\left(\frac{1}{x_1}+\frac{1}{x_2}+\ldots+\frac{1}{x_n}\right) \leq \frac{n^2(a+b)^2}{Cab}.
\]

### Step 1: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
\left(x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n\right)\left(\frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{x_n}\right) \geq n^2.
\]

This means that:

\[
\left(x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n\right)\left(\frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} + \ldots + \frac{1}{x_n}\right) \geq n^2.
\]

### Step 2: Find the Bound

We need to find the largest \( C \) such that:

\[
n^2 \leq \frac{n^2(a+b)^2}{Cab}.
\]

Dividing both sides by \( n^2 \) (assuming \( n > 0 \)) gives:

\[
1 \leq \frac{(a+b)^2}{Cab}.
\]

Rearranging this inequality yields:

\[
Cab \leq (a+b)^2.
\]

Thus, we can express \( C \) as:

\[
C \leq \frac{(a+b)^2}{ab}.
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the Expression

Now, we simplify \( \frac{(a+b)^2}{ab} \):

\[
\frac{(a+b)^2}{ab} = \frac{a^2 + 2ab + b^2}{ab} = \frac{a^2}{ab} + 2 + \frac{b^2}{ab} = \frac{a}{b} + 2 + \frac{b}{a}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the Expression

To find the maximum value of \( C \), we need to minimize \( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a} \). By the AM-GM inequality:

\[
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a} \geq 2.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
C \leq 2 + 2 = 4.
\]

### Step 5: Check if Equality Holds

Equality in the AM-GM inequality holds when \( a = b \). However, since \( 0 < a < b \), we cannot achieve equality, but we can approach it as \( a \) approaches \( b \).

### Conclusion

The largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( x_i \in [a, b] \) is:

\[
C = 4.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=4.
