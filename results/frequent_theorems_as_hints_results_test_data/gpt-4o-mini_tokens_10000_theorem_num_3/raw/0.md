Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality 

$$(a + 1)(d + 1) - \frac{3}{4d^3} \geq 2C$$ 

under the constraints \( a, b, c, d > 0 \) such that \( a \leq b \leq c \leq d \) and \( abcd = 1 \).

### Step 1: Express \( a \) in terms of \( d \)

Since \( abcd = 1 \), we can express \( a \) as:

$$ a = \frac{1}{bcd}. $$

Given that \( a \leq b \leq c \leq d \), we can also express \( b, c \) in terms of \( d \) by letting \( b = kd \) and \( c = md \) for some \( k, m \) such that \( 0 < k, m \leq 1 \). Thus, we have:

$$ abcd = \left(\frac{1}{bcd}\right) b c d = 1 \implies \frac{1}{(kd)(md)d} = 1 \implies kmd = 1. $$

### Step 2: Analyze the left-hand side of the inequality

Now, we can rewrite the left-hand side of the inequality:

$$(a + 1)(d + 1) = \left(\frac{1}{bcd} + 1\right)(d + 1) = \left(\frac{1 + bcd}{bcd}\right)(d + 1).$$

### Step 3: Simplify the expression

We can simplify this expression further:

$$ (a + 1)(d + 1) = \frac{(1 + bcd)(d + 1)}{bcd} = \frac{(1 + bcd)(d + 1)}{bcd} = \frac{d + 1 + bcd^2 + bcd}{bcd}. $$

### Step 4: Substitute \( d \) and find bounds

To find the minimal constant \( C \), we need to analyze the expression as \( d \) varies. We can set \( d = 1 \) (since \( abcd = 1 \) and \( a, b, c, d \) are positive). This gives us:

$$ a = b = c = d = 1. $$

Substituting \( d = 1 \) into the inequality:

$$(1 + 1)(1 + 1) - \frac{3}{4 \cdot 1^3} \geq 2C$$

This simplifies to:

$$ 4 - \frac{3}{4} \geq 2C \implies 4 - 0.75 = 3.25 \geq 2C \implies C \leq \frac{3.25}{2} = 1.625. $$

### Step 5: Check for equality

To check if \( C = 1.625 \) is achievable, we can consider the case where \( a = b = c = d = 1 \). In this case, we have:

$$(1 + 1)(1 + 1) - \frac{3}{4 \cdot 1^3} = 4 - 0.75 = 3.25,$$

which gives \( 2C = 3.25 \) or \( C = 1.625 \).

### Conclusion

Thus, the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a, b, c, d \) under the given conditions is:

The answer is \( C = 1.625 \).
