Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the condition given: \( x + y + z = xyz \). We want to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{1}{1+x^2} + \frac{1}{1+y^2} + \frac{1}{1+z^2} \geq C
\]

holds for all real numbers \( x, y, z \) satisfying the condition.

### Step 1: Analyze the constraint

The constraint \( x + y + z = xyz \) can be rewritten in a more manageable form. We can express \( x, y, z \) in terms of a single variable. A common substitution is to let \( x = \tan A \), \( y = \tan B \), \( z = \tan C \) where \( A + B + C = \pi \). This substitution is valid because the tangent function maps the angles in the interval \( (0, \frac{\pi}{2}) \) to real numbers.

### Step 2: Rewrite the inequality

Using the substitution \( x = \tan A \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{1+x^2} = \cos^2 A
\]

Thus, the inequality becomes:

\[
\cos^2 A + \cos^2 B + \cos^2 C \geq C
\]

### Step 3: Use the identity for cosine squares

We know from the identity \( \cos^2 A + \cos^2 B + \cos^2 C = 1 - \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B - \sin^2 C \). Since \( A + B + C = \pi \), we can use the fact that \( \sin^2 A + \sin^2 B + \sin^2 C = 2 - 2\cos A \cos B \cos C \).

### Step 4: Find the minimum value of \( \cos^2 A + \cos^2 B + \cos^2 C \)

To find the minimum value of \( \cos^2 A + \cos^2 B + \cos^2 C \), we can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\[
(\cos^2 A + \cos^2 B + \cos^2 C)(1 + 1 + 1) \geq (\cos A + \cos B + \cos C)^2
\]

This gives us:

\[
3(\cos^2 A + \cos^2 B + \cos^2 C) \geq (\cos A + \cos B + \cos C)^2
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the maximum of \( \cos A + \cos B + \cos C \)

The maximum value of \( \cos A + \cos B + \cos C \) occurs when \( A = B = C = \frac{\pi}{3} \), giving \( \cos A + \cos B + \cos C = \frac{3}{2} \). Thus:

\[
(\cos A + \cos B + \cos C)^2 \leq \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{4}
\]

### Step 6: Find the minimum of \( \cos^2 A + \cos^2 B + \cos^2 C \)

From the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
3(\cos^2 A + \cos^2 B + \cos^2 C) \geq \frac{9}{4}
\]

Thus:

\[
\cos^2 A + \cos^2 B + \cos^2 C \geq \frac{3}{4}
\]

### Conclusion

The minimum value of \( \cos^2 A + \cos^2 B + \cos^2 C \) is \( \frac{3}{4} \). Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( x, y, z \) satisfying \( x + y + z = xyz \) is:

\[
C = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C = \frac{3}{4}
\]
