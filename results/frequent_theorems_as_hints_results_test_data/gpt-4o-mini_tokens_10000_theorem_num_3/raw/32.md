Problem: Let $n$ be a natural number such that $n \geq 2$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $n$:

Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality given:

\[
\frac{1}{n+1}\left(1+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2n-1}\right) \geq C \cdot \frac{1}{n}\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\right).
\]

### Step 1: Simplifying the Left Side

The left side involves the sum of the first \( n \) odd reciprocals:

\[
1 + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2n-1} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2k-1}.
\]

This sum can be approximated using the harmonic series. The sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers can be expressed as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2k-1} \approx \frac{1}{2} \ln(n) + \frac{1}{2} \ln(2) + O(1) \text{ as } n \to \infty.
\]

### Step 2: Simplifying the Right Side

The right side involves the sum of the first \( n \) natural reciprocals:

\[
1 + \frac{1}{2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n} = H_n \approx \ln(n) + \gamma \text{ (where \( \gamma \) is the Euler-Mascheroni constant)}.
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the right side as:

\[
C \cdot \frac{1}{n} H_n \approx C \cdot \frac{1}{n} (\ln(n) + \gamma).
\]

### Step 3: Setting Up the Inequality

Now we can rewrite the inequality as:

\[
\frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2k-1} \geq C \cdot \frac{1}{n} H_n.
\]

Substituting the approximations, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{n+1} \left( \frac{1}{2} \ln(n) + O(1) \right) \geq C \cdot \frac{1}{n} (\ln(n) + \gamma).
\]

### Step 4: Analyzing the Leading Terms

As \( n \to \infty \), the leading terms dominate, and we can focus on:

\[
\frac{1}{n+1} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \ln(n) \geq C \cdot \frac{1}{n} \ln(n).
\]

Dividing both sides by \( \ln(n) \) (valid for large \( n \)) gives:

\[
\frac{1}{n+1} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \geq C \cdot \frac{1}{n}.
\]

### Step 5: Finding the Constant \( C \)

Rearranging this inequality leads to:

\[
C \leq \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{n}{n+1}.
\]

As \( n \to \infty \), \( \frac{n}{n+1} \to 1 \). Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all \( n \geq 2 \) is:

\[
C = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( n \geq 2 \) is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
