Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
x y(y + 4z) + y z(z + 4x) + z x(x + 4y) \leq C
\]

holds for all positive \( x, y, z \) satisfying \( x + y + z = 1 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Expression

We can rewrite the left-hand side of the inequality:

\[
x y(y + 4z) = x y^2 + 4 x y z,
\]
\[
y z(z + 4x) = y z^2 + 4 y z x,
\]
\[
z x(x + 4y) = z x^2 + 4 z x y.
\]

Combining these, we have:

\[
x y^2 + y z^2 + z x^2 + 4 (x y z + y z x + z x y) = x y^2 + y z^2 + z x^2 + 4xyz(x + y + z).
\]

Since \( x + y + z = 1 \), we can simplify this to:

\[
x y^2 + y z^2 + z x^2 + 4xyz.
\]

### Step 2: Use Symmetry and Test Cases

To find the maximum value of \( x y^2 + y z^2 + z x^2 + 4xyz \), we can test some symmetric cases. 

1. **Case 1: \( x = y = z = \frac{1}{3} \)**

Calculating:

\[
x y^2 + y z^2 + z x^2 = 3 \left(\frac{1}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2\right) = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{9}.
\]

And,

\[
4xyz = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{27} = \frac{4}{27}.
\]

Thus,

\[
x y^2 + y z^2 + z x^2 + 4xyz = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{4}{27} = \frac{3}{27} + \frac{4}{27} = \frac{7}{27}.
\]

2. **Case 2: \( x = 1, y = 0, z = 0 \)**

Calculating:

\[
x y^2 + y z^2 + z x^2 + 4xyz = 0.
\]

3. **Case 3: \( x = \frac{1}{2}, y = \frac{1}{2}, z = 0 \)**

Calculating:

\[
x y^2 + y z^2 + z x^2 + 4xyz = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare Values

From the cases we calculated:

- Case 1 gave \( \frac{7}{27} \).
- Case 2 gave \( 0 \).
- Case 3 gave \( \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3.375}{27} \).

The maximum value we found is \( \frac{7}{27} \).

### Conclusion

Thus, the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( x, y, z \) with \( x + y + z = 1 \) is:

\[
C = \frac{7}{27}.
\]

Therefore, the answer is 

\[
\text{The answer is } C = \frac{7}{27}.
\]
