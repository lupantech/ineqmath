Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality \( 9abc + 3 \quad () \quad 7(ab + bc + ca) \) under the condition \( a + b + c = 1 \) for \( a, b, c > 0 \), we will analyze both sides of the inequality.

### Step 1: Analyze the left-hand side

The left-hand side is \( 9abc + 3 \). We can see that \( abc \) is maximized when \( a = b = c \) due to the symmetry and the AM-GM inequality. 

Using the condition \( a + b + c = 1 \), we set \( a = b = c = \frac{1}{3} \):
\[
abc = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{27}.
\]
Thus,
\[
9abc = 9 \cdot \frac{1}{27} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
9abc + 3 = \frac{1}{3} + 3 = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{9}{3} = \frac{10}{3}.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the right-hand side

Now, we analyze the right-hand side \( 7(ab + bc + ca) \). Again, we can use the condition \( a + b + c = 1 \) and the symmetry of the variables. 

Using \( a = b = c = \frac{1}{3} \):
\[
ab + bc + ca = 3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3}\right) = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Thus,
\[
7(ab + bc + ca) = 7 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: Compare both sides

Now we compare the two results:
- Left-hand side: \( 9abc + 3 = \frac{10}{3} \)
- Right-hand side: \( 7(ab + bc + ca) = \frac{7}{3} \)

We can see that:
\[
\frac{10}{3} > \frac{7}{3}.
\]

### Conclusion

Since \( 9abc + 3 > 7(ab + bc + ca) \), we conclude that the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:
\[
9abc + 3 \geq 7(ab + bc + ca).
\]

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\text{The answer is (B) } \geq.
\]
