Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression given:

\[
S = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\min \left\{x_{i-1}, x_i\right\} \cdot \max \left\{x_i, x_{i+1}\right\}}{x_i}
\]

where \(x_0 = x_n\) and \(x_{n+1} = x_1\). 

### Step 1: Understanding the Terms

1. **Min and Max Functions**: 
   - The term \(\min \{x_{i-1}, x_i\}\) takes the smaller of \(x_{i-1}\) and \(x_i\).
   - The term \(\max \{x_i, x_{i+1}\}\) takes the larger of \(x_i\) and \(x_{i+1}\).

2. **Expression Simplification**:
   - The expression can be rewritten as:
   \[
   S = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\min \{x_{i-1}, x_i\}}{x_i} \cdot \max \{x_i, x_{i+1}\}
   \]

### Step 2: Analyzing the Components

- **Behavior of \(\min\) and \(\max\)**:
  - Since \(x_i\) are positive and sum to 1, we can analyze the behavior of the terms.
  - The term \(\frac{\min \{x_{i-1}, x_i\}}{x_i}\) is always less than or equal to 1 because \(\min \{x_{i-1}, x_i\} \leq x_i\).

### Step 3: Applying Inequalities

1. **Bounding the Terms**:
   - Since \(\min \{x_{i-1}, x_i\} \leq x_i\), we have:
   \[
   \frac{\min \{x_{i-1}, x_i\}}{x_i} \leq 1
   \]
   - Therefore, each term in the sum \(S\) is bounded above by \(\max \{x_i, x_{i+1}\}\).

2. **Using Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**:
   - We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the sums involved:
   \[
   \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \min \{x_{i-1}, x_i\}\right) \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \max \{x_i, x_{i+1}\}\right) \geq \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\min \{x_{i-1}, x_i\} \cdot \max \{x_i, x_{i+1}\}}{x_i}\right)^2
   \]

### Step 4: Conclusion

- The sum \(S\) is a weighted average of the terms \(\min\) and \(\max\), and since \(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n = 1\), we can conclude that the expression \(S\) is less than or equal to 1.
- Thus, we can conclude that:

\[
S \leq 1
\]

### Final Answer

The correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (A) $\leq$.
