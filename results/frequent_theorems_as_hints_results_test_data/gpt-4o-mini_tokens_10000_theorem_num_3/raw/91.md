Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality 

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + \left|x^2 + y^2 + z^2\right| \geq C
\]

given the constraint \( |x + 2y + 3z| = 1 \).

### Step 1: Simplifying the Expression

Let \( S = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \). The inequality can be rewritten as:

\[
S + |S| \geq C
\]

### Step 2: Analyzing \( S + |S| \)

The expression \( S + |S| \) behaves differently depending on whether \( S \) is non-negative or negative:

- If \( S \geq 0 \), then \( S + |S| = 2S \).
- If \( S < 0 \), then \( S + |S| = 0 \).

Thus, we can conclude that:

\[
S + |S| \geq 0
\]

### Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound for \( S \)

To find the largest constant \( C \), we need to determine the minimum value of \( S \) under the constraint \( |x + 2y + 3z| = 1 \).

### Step 4: Using the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the vectors \( (1, 2, 3) \) and \( (x, y, z) \):

\[
|x + 2y + 3z|^2 \leq (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
\]

Calculating the left-hand side:

\[
|x + 2y + 3z|^2 = 1^2 = 1
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
1 \leq 14(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
\]

This implies:

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \geq \frac{1}{14}
\]

### Step 5: Finding the Minimum Value of \( S \)

From the above inequality, we find that the minimum value of \( S \) is:

\[
S \geq \frac{1}{14}
\]

### Step 6: Evaluating \( S + |S| \)

Since \( S \geq 0 \), we have:

\[
S + |S| = 2S \geq 2 \cdot \frac{1}{14} = \frac{1}{7}
\]

### Step 7: Conclusion

Thus, the inequality \( S + |S| \geq C \) holds for \( C = \frac{1}{7} \). Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( x, y, z \) satisfying the given condition is:

\[
\boxed{C = \frac{1}{7}}
\]

Finally, we state the answer in the required format:

The answer is \( C = \frac{1}{7} \).
