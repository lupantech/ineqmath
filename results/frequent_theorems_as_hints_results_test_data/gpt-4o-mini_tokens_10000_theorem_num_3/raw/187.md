Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
x^2 + \frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)} \quad () \quad 6 - \sqrt[3]{6} - \frac{5}{4} \sqrt[3]{36},
\]

we first need to evaluate the right-hand side expression \(6 - \sqrt[3]{6} - \frac{5}{4} \sqrt[3]{36}\).

1. **Calculate \(\sqrt[3]{36}\)**:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{36} = \sqrt[3]{6^2} = (\sqrt[3]{6})^2.
   \]

2. **Substituting \(\sqrt[3]{36}\)** into the expression:
   \[
   6 - \sqrt[3]{6} - \frac{5}{4} (\sqrt[3]{6})^2.
   \]

3. **Let \(y = \sqrt[3]{6}\)**, then the expression simplifies to:
   \[
   6 - y - \frac{5}{4} y^2.
   \]

4. **Rearranging the expression**:
   \[
   6 - y - \frac{5}{4} y^2 = 6 - y - \frac{5}{4} y^2.
   \]

5. **Finding the critical points**:
   To analyze the inequality, we need to find the minimum value of the left-hand side \(x^2 + \frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)}\).

6. **Analyzing \(x^2\)**:
   The term \(x^2\) is minimized at \(x = 0\), where \(x^2 = 0\).

7. **Analyzing \(\frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)}\)**:
   - For \(x < 2\), \(|x-2| = 2-x\), so:
     \[
     \frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)} = \frac{1}{6(1 + 2 - x)} = \frac{1}{6(3-x)}.
     \]
   - For \(x \geq 2\), \(|x-2| = x-2\), so:
     \[
     \frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)} = \frac{1}{6(1 + x - 2)} = \frac{1}{6(x-1)}.
     \]

8. **Finding the minimum of the left-hand side**:
   - For \(x < 2\), as \(x\) approaches 2, \(\frac{1}{6(3-x)}\) approaches \(\frac{1}{6(1)} = \frac{1}{6}\).
   - For \(x \geq 2\), as \(x\) increases, \(\frac{1}{6(x-1)}\) approaches 0.

   Therefore, the minimum value of the left-hand side occurs at \(x = 2\):
   \[
   2^2 + \frac{1}{6(1+0)} = 4 + \frac{1}{6} = 4 + 0.1667 \approx 4.1667.
   \]

9. **Evaluating the right-hand side**:
   We need to evaluate \(6 - y - \frac{5}{4}y^2\) at \(y = \sqrt[3]{6}\):
   - We can approximate \(y\) as \(1.817\) (since \(\sqrt[3]{6} \approx 1.817\)).
   - Calculate \(6 - 1.817 - \frac{5}{4}(1.817^2)\):
     \[
     1.817^2 \approx 3.303,
     \]
     \[
     \frac{5}{4} \cdot 3.303 \approx 4.129.
     \]
     \[
     6 - 1.817 - 4.129 \approx 0.054.
     \]

10. **Comparing the two sides**:
    The left-hand side minimum value \(4.1667\) is greater than the right-hand side \(0.054\).

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
x^2 + \frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)} \geq 6 - \sqrt[3]{6} - \frac{5}{4} \sqrt[3]{36}.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
