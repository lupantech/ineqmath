Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given recurrence relation for the sequence \( (a_n)_{n \geq 0} \):

\[
a_{n+1} \geq a_n^2 + \frac{1}{5}
\]

We will analyze the behavior of the sequence \( a_n \) and then compare \( \sqrt{a_{n+5}} \) with \( a_{n-5}^2 \).

### Step 1: Establish a lower bound for \( a_n \)

We can use the recurrence relation to derive a lower bound for \( a_n \). Let's denote \( a_0 \) as the initial term of the sequence. We can compute a few terms:

- For \( n = 0 \):
  \[
  a_1 \geq a_0^2 + \frac{1}{5}
  \]

- For \( n = 1 \):
  \[
  a_2 \geq a_1^2 + \frac{1}{5} \geq (a_0^2 + \frac{1}{5})^2 + \frac{1}{5}
  \]

Continuing this process, we can see that each term is at least as large as the square of the previous term plus a constant. This suggests that the sequence grows rapidly.

### Step 2: Analyze the growth of \( a_n \)

Assuming \( a_n \) is non-negative, we can see that if \( a_n \) is large, then \( a_{n+1} \) will be even larger due to the squaring term. This indicates that \( a_n \) is likely to grow without bound.

### Step 3: Compare \( \sqrt{a_{n+5}} \) and \( a_{n-5}^2 \)

Now, we need to analyze the inequality:

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \quad () \quad a_{n-5}^2
\]

To do this, we will use the recurrence relation iteratively to express \( a_{n+5} \) in terms of earlier terms.

From the recurrence relation, we have:

\[
a_{n+5} \geq a_{n+4}^2 + \frac{1}{5}
\]
\[
a_{n+4} \geq a_{n+3}^2 + \frac{1}{5}
\]
\[
a_{n+3} \geq a_{n+2}^2 + \frac{1}{5}
\]
\[
a_{n+2} \geq a_{n+1}^2 + \frac{1}{5}
\]
\[
a_{n+1} \geq a_n^2 + \frac{1}{5}
\]

By continuing this process, we can see that \( a_{n+5} \) is at least as large as a function of \( a_n \) raised to a power, plus a constant. 

### Step 4: Establish the relationship

Given that \( a_n \) grows rapidly, we can intuitively argue that:

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq a_{n-5}^2
\]

This is because \( a_{n+5} \) is derived from squaring terms that are already large, while \( a_{n-5}^2 \) is just the square of a term that is further back in the sequence. 

### Conclusion

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq a_{n-5}^2
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
