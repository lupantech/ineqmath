Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\sum \frac{(b^2+c^2)(a-b)(a-c)}{(a+b)(a+c)} \quad () \quad a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2ab - 3bc - ca,
\]

we will analyze both sides of the inequality step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Left Side

The left side of the inequality is 

\[
\sum \frac{(b^2+c^2)(a-b)(a-c)}{(a+b)(a+c)}.
\]

This expression can be expanded for each cyclic permutation of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Let's consider one term:

\[
\frac{(b^2+c^2)(a-b)(a-c)}{(a+b)(a+c)}.
\]

### Step 2: Simplifying the Left Side

We can analyze the term \((a-b)(a-c)\):

\[
(a-b)(a-c) = a^2 - (b+c)a + bc.
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the left side as:

\[
\sum \frac{(b^2+c^2)(a^2 - (b+c)a + bc)}{(a+b)(a+c)}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the Right Side

The right side of the inequality is 

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2ab - 3bc - ca.
\]

This can be rearranged as:

\[
(a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2 - 3bc.
\]

### Step 4: Compare Both Sides

To compare both sides, we need to understand the behavior of the left side. The left side is a sum of positive terms (since \(a, b, c > 0\)) and is influenced by the differences \((a-b)\) and \((a-c)\). 

### Step 5: Use Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the left side:

\[
\left(\sum (b^2+c^2)(a-b)(a-c)\right) \left(\sum \frac{1}{(a+b)(a+c)}\right) \geq \left(\sum (a-b)(a-c)\right)^2.
\]

This shows that the left side is non-negative.

### Step 6: Evaluate the Right Side

The right side can be negative depending on the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For example, if \(b\) and \(c\) are significantly larger than \(a\), the right side can become negative.

### Conclusion

Given that the left side is a sum of non-negative terms and the right side can be negative, we conclude that:

\[
\sum \frac{(b^2+c^2)(a-b)(a-c)}{(a+b)(a+c)} \geq a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2ab - 3bc - ca.
\]

Thus, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

\[
\sum \frac{(b^2+c^2)(a-b)(a-c)}{(a+b)(a+c)} \geq a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2ab - 3bc - ca.
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
