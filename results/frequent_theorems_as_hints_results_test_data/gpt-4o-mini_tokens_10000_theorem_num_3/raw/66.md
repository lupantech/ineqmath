Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the geometry of the isosceles triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \overline{AB} = \overline{AC} \) and the tangents to the circumcircle at points \( A \) and \( B \) intersecting at point \( D \).

1. **Understanding the Geometry**:
   - Let \( O \) be the circumcenter of triangle \( ABC \).
   - The angles \( \angle DAB \) and \( \angle DBA \) are equal because \( D \) lies on the tangents to the circumcircle at points \( A \) and \( B \). Thus, \( \angle DAB = \angle DBA = \theta \).
   - The angle \( \angle AOB \) is the central angle corresponding to arc \( AB \) in the circumcircle.

2. **Relating Angles**:
   - The angle \( \angle ACB \) is the inscribed angle that subtends arc \( AB \), so we have:
     \[
     \angle ACB = \frac{1}{2} \angle AOB.
     \]
   - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles, we denote \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = x \). Therefore, \( \angle AOB = 2x \).

3. **Finding \( \angle DCB \)**:
   - The angle \( \angle DCB \) can be expressed in terms of \( \theta \) and \( x \):
     \[
     \angle DCB = 180^\circ - \angle DAB - \angle ACB = 180^\circ - \theta - x.
     \]
   - We also know that \( \theta = 90^\circ - x \) because the tangents at points \( A \) and \( B \) create right angles with the radii \( OA \) and \( OB \) at those points.

4. **Substituting for \( \theta \)**:
   - Substituting \( \theta \) into the expression for \( \angle DCB \):
     \[
     \angle DCB = 180^\circ - (90^\circ - x) - x = 180^\circ - 90^\circ + x - x = 90^\circ.
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \( \angle DCB \) is always \( 90^\circ \) for any isosceles triangle \( \triangle ABC \), we conclude that the maximum value of \( \angle DCB \) is \( 90^\circ \).
   - Therefore, the minimal constant \( C \) such that \( \angle DCB \leq C \) for all such triangles is \( C = 90^\circ \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The answer is } C=90.
\]
