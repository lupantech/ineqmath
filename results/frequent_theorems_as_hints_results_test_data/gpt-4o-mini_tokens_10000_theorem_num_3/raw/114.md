Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given expressions and the conditions provided. We have:

1. \( a, b, c, d \) are positive real numbers such that \( abcd = 1 \).
2. The inequality \( a + b + c + d > \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{d} + \frac{d}{a} \) holds.

We need to compare the expressions:

- \( a + b + c + d \)
- \( \frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d} \)

### Step 1: Analyze the second expression

Using the property \( abcd = 1 \), we can rewrite each term in the second expression:

\[
\frac{b}{a} = \frac{bcd}{abcd} = \frac{bcd}{1} = bcd
\]
\[
\frac{c}{b} = \frac{cad}{abcd} = \frac{cad}{1} = cad
\]
\[
\frac{d}{c} = \frac{dab}{abcd} = \frac{dab}{1} = dab
\]
\[
\frac{a}{d} = \frac{abc}{abcd} = \frac{abc}{1} = abc
\]

Thus, we can express the second term as:

\[
\frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d} = bcd + cad + dab + abc
\]

### Step 2: Apply the AM-GM Inequality

We can apply the AM-GM inequality to both expressions:

1. For \( a + b + c + d \):

\[
\frac{a + b + c + d}{4} \geq \sqrt[4]{abcd} = \sqrt[4]{1} = 1
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
a + b + c + d \geq 4
\]

2. For \( \frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d} \):

Using the AM-GM inequality again:

\[
\frac{\frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d}}{4} \geq \sqrt[4]{\frac{b}{a} \cdot \frac{c}{b} \cdot \frac{d}{c} \cdot \frac{a}{d}} = \sqrt[4]{1} = 1
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d} \geq 4
\]

### Step 3: Compare the two expressions

From the inequalities derived, we have:

\[
a + b + c + d \geq 4
\]
\[
\frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d} \geq 4
\]

However, we also know from the problem statement that:

\[
a + b + c + d > \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{d} + \frac{d}{a}
\]

This implies that \( a + b + c + d \) is strictly greater than \( \frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d} \).

### Conclusion

Since \( a + b + c + d > \frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d} \), we conclude that:

\[
a + b + c + d \quad > \quad \frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d}
\]

Thus, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (E) $>$.
