Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
(a+b)(c+a)^2 \geq C a b c
\]

holds for all \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( 0 < a \leq b \leq c \).

### Step 1: Analyze the left-hand side

We start by expanding the left-hand side:

\[
(a+b)(c+a)^2 = (a+b)(c^2 + 2ac + a^2) = (a+b)(c^2 + 2ac + a^2) = ac^2 + 2a^2c + a^3 + bc^2 + 2abc + ab^2
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the right-hand side

The right-hand side is simply \( C a b c \).

### Step 3: Test specific values

To find the largest \( C \), we can test specific values of \( a, b, c \). A natural choice is to set \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 1 \):

\[
(1+1)(1+1)^2 = 2 \cdot 4 = 8
\]
\[
C \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = C
\]

This gives us \( 8 \geq C \), so \( C \leq 8 \).

### Step 4: Test another set of values

Next, we can test \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 2 \):

\[
(1+1)(2+1)^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18
\]
\[
C \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 2C
\]

This gives us \( 18 \geq 2C \), or \( C \leq 9 \).

### Step 5: Test another set of values

Now, let’s try \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = 2 \):

\[
(1+2)(2+1)^2 = 3 \cdot 9 = 27
\]
\[
C \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 4C
\]

This gives us \( 27 \geq 4C \), or \( C \leq \frac{27}{4} = 6.75 \).

### Step 6: Test the boundary case

Now, let’s test the case where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c \to \infty \):

\[
(1+1)(c+1)^2 = 2(c^2 + 2c + 1) \approx 2c^2
\]
\[
C \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot c = Cc
\]

For large \( c \), we have \( 2c^2 \geq Cc \), which simplifies to \( 2c \geq C \). Thus, \( C \) can be at most \( 2 \).

### Step 7: Conclusion

After testing various values, we find that the largest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all \( a, b, c \) under the given constraints is \( C = 8 \).

Thus, the answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=8
\]
