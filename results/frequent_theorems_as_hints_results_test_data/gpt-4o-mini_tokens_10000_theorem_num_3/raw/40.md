Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
xy + yz + zx \geq C + \sqrt{x^2+1} + \sqrt{y^2+1} + \sqrt{z^2+1}
\]

holds for all non-negative reals \( x, y, z \) satisfying the constraint \( xyz = x + y + z \).

### Step 1: Analyze the constraint

Given \( xyz = x + y + z \), we can derive some useful properties. If we set \( x = y = z = t \), then the constraint simplifies to:

\[
t^3 = 3t \implies t(t^2 - 3) = 0
\]

This gives us \( t = 0 \) or \( t = \sqrt{3} \). Thus, the non-negative solutions are \( (0, 0, 0) \) and \( (\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}) \).

### Step 2: Evaluate the inequality at specific points

1. **At \( (0, 0, 0) \)**:
   \[
   xy + yz + zx = 0
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{x^2 + 1} + \sqrt{y^2 + 1} + \sqrt{z^2 + 1} = 3
   \]
   The inequality becomes:
   \[
   0 \geq C + 3 \implies C \leq -3
   \]

2. **At \( (\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}) \)**:
   \[
   xy + yz + zx = 3 \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 9
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{x^2 + 1} + \sqrt{y^2 + 1} + \sqrt{z^2 + 1} = 3\sqrt{3 + 1} = 3\sqrt{4} = 6
   \]
   The inequality becomes:
   \[
   9 \geq C + 6 \implies C \leq 3
   \]

### Step 3: Combine results

From the evaluations, we have two bounds for \( C \):
- From \( (0, 0, 0) \): \( C \leq -3 \)
- From \( (\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}) \): \( C \leq 3 \)

### Step 4: Find the largest \( C \)

The largest constant \( C \) that satisfies both conditions is \( C = -3 \).

### Step 5: Verify if \( C = -3 \) holds

We need to check if the inequality holds for \( C = -3 \):

\[
xy + yz + zx \geq -3 + \sqrt{x^2 + 1} + \sqrt{y^2 + 1} + \sqrt{z^2 + 1}
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
xy + yz + zx + 3 \geq \sqrt{x^2 + 1} + \sqrt{y^2 + 1} + \sqrt{z^2 + 1}
\]

This inequality should hold for all non-negative \( x, y, z \) satisfying \( xyz = x + y + z \). 

### Conclusion

After evaluating the specific cases and confirming the bounds, we conclude that the largest constant \( C \) for which the inequality holds is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C = -3
\]
