Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression \( u^2 \tan A + v^2 \tan B + w^2 \tan C \) in relation to the area \( \Delta \) of triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

### Step 1: Understanding the terms

1. **Perpendicular lengths**: The lengths \( u, v, w \) are the lengths of the perpendiculars from vertices \( A, B, C \) to the line \( L \).
2. **Area of the triangle**: The area \( \Delta \) of triangle \( ABC \) can be expressed in terms of the sides \( a, b, c \) and angles \( A, B, C \) as:
   \[
   \Delta = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = \frac{1}{2}ca \sin B
   \]

### Step 2: Relating the expression to the area

Using the definition of the area in terms of the perpendiculars, we can express the area as:
\[
\Delta = \frac{1}{2} (u + v + w) \cdot d
\]
where \( d \) is the length of the line segment along \( L \) that connects the feet of the perpendiculars from \( A, B, C \).

### Step 3: Applying Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the expression \( u^2 \tan A + v^2 \tan B + w^2 \tan C \):
\[
(u^2 \tan A + v^2 \tan B + w^2 \tan C)(\tan A + \tan B + \tan C) \geq (u + v + w)^2
\]

### Step 4: Relating \( \tan A + \tan B + \tan C \) to the area

From the properties of triangles, we know that:
\[
\tan A + \tan B + \tan C = \frac{a}{\Delta} + \frac{b}{\Delta} + \frac{c}{\Delta} = \frac{a + b + c}{\Delta}
\]
This means that \( \tan A + \tan B + \tan C \) is positive and relates to the sides of the triangle and its area.

### Step 5: Analyzing the inequality

Now, we can analyze the inequality:
\[
u^2 \tan A + v^2 \tan B + w^2 \tan C \geq \frac{(u + v + w)^2}{\tan A + \tan B + \tan C}
\]
This suggests that the left-hand side is greater than or equal to a certain value, which is related to the area \( \Delta \).

### Step 6: Conclusion

Given that \( u, v, w \) are lengths of perpendiculars and \( \tan A, \tan B, \tan C \) are positive, we can conclude that:
\[
u^2 \tan A + v^2 \tan B + w^2 \tan C \geq \Delta
\]
Thus, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:
\[
u^2 \tan A + v^2 \tan B + w^2 \tan C \geq \Delta
\]

Therefore, the answer is:
The answer is (B) $\geq$.
