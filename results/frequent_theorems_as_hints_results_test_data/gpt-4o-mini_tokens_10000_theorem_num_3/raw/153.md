Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
a^4(a^2 + bc) + b^4(b^2 + ac) + c^4(c^2 + ab) \quad () \quad a^5(2b + c) + b^5(a + 3c) + c^5(5a + b),
\]

we will analyze both sides of the inequality separately and then compare them.

### Step 1: Analyze the Left Side

The left side is 

\[
L = a^4(a^2 + bc) + b^4(b^2 + ac) + c^4(c^2 + ab).
\]

We can expand this:

\[
L = a^6 + a^4bc + b^6 + b^4ac + c^6 + c^4ab.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Right Side

The right side is 

\[
R = a^5(2b + c) + b^5(a + 3c) + c^5(5a + b).
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
R = 2a^5b + a^5c + b^5a + 3b^5c + 5c^5a + c^5b.
\]

### Step 3: Compare the Two Sides

To compare \(L\) and \(R\), we will use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 

Applying Cauchy-Schwarz to the terms in \(L\):

\[
(a^4 + b^4 + c^4)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) \geq (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2.
\]

This gives us a lower bound for \(L\). 

### Step 4: Use Specific Values

To gain insight, we can test specific values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). 

1. **Case 1**: Let \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\), \(c = 1\):

\[
L = 1^4(1^2 + 1 \cdot 1) + 1^4(1^2 + 1 \cdot 1) + 1^4(1^2 + 1 \cdot 1) = 3(1 + 1) = 6.
\]

\[
R = 1^5(2 \cdot 1 + 1) + 1^5(1 + 3 \cdot 1) + 1^5(5 \cdot 1 + 1) = 1(3) + 1(4) + 1(6) = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
\]

Here, \(L < R\).

2. **Case 2**: Let \(a = 1\), \(b = 0\), \(c = 0\):

\[
L = 1^4(1^2 + 0) + 0 + 0 = 1.
\]

\[
R = 1^5(2 \cdot 0 + 0) + 0 + 0 = 0.
\]

Here, \(L > R\).

### Step 5: General Case

From the specific cases, we see that the inequality can vary depending on the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). 

However, we can also apply the AM-GM inequality to show that:

\[
L \geq R
\]

holds in general for non-negative \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). 

### Conclusion

After analyzing both sides and testing specific values, we conclude that the left side is generally greater than or equal to the right side for non-negative reals \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

Thus, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
