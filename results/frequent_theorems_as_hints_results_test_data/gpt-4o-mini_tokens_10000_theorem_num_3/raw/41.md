Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the recurrence relation given for the sequence \( (a_n)_{n \geq 0} \):

\[
a_{n+1} \geq a_n^2 + \frac{1}{5}.
\]

We want to find the maximal constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq a_{n-5}^2 + C
\]

holds for all \( n \geq 5 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the recurrence relation

We can analyze the growth of the sequence \( a_n \) using the recurrence relation. Starting from an initial value \( a_0 \), we can derive a few terms:

- \( a_1 \geq a_0^2 + \frac{1}{5} \)
- \( a_2 \geq a_1^2 + \frac{1}{5} \geq (a_0^2 + \frac{1}{5})^2 + \frac{1}{5} \)

Continuing this process, we see that \( a_n \) grows at least quadratically. 

### Step 2: Establish a lower bound for \( a_n \)

To find a lower bound for \( a_n \), we can assume \( a_0 \) is some positive constant. We can show that \( a_n \) grows without bound. For large \( n \), we can assume \( a_n \) is large enough that \( a_n^2 \) dominates the \( \frac{1}{5} \) term. 

Letâ€™s denote \( a_n \) as \( a_n \geq 2^{2^n} \) for sufficiently large \( n \). This is a rough estimate, but it shows that \( a_n \) grows very quickly.

### Step 3: Analyze the inequality we want to satisfy

We need to satisfy:

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq a_{n-5}^2 + C.
\]

Using our lower bound, we can estimate:

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq \sqrt{2^{2^{n+5}}} = 2^{2^{n+5}/2} = 2^{2^{n+4}}.
\]

For \( a_{n-5} \), we have:

\[
a_{n-5} \geq 2^{2^{n-5}}.
\]

Thus,

\[
a_{n-5}^2 \geq (2^{2^{n-5}})^2 = 2^{2 \cdot 2^{n-5}} = 2^{2^{n-4}}.
\]

### Step 4: Set up the inequality

Now we need to ensure:

\[
2^{2^{n+4}} \geq 2^{2^{n-4}} + C.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2^{2^{n+4}} - 2^{2^{n-4}} \geq C.
\]

### Step 5: Find the maximal \( C \)

As \( n \) becomes large, the term \( 2^{2^{n+4}} \) grows much faster than \( 2^{2^{n-4}} \). Therefore, we can analyze the difference:

\[
2^{2^{n+4}} - 2^{2^{n-4}} \approx 2^{2^{n+4}} \text{ for large } n.
\]

Thus, we can conclude that \( C \) can be as large as \( 2^{2^{n+4}} \) for large \( n \). However, we need a constant \( C \) that works for all \( n \geq 5 \).

### Conclusion

The smallest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all \( n \geq 5 \) is \( C = \frac{1}{5} \), as this is the minimum increment we can guarantee from the recurrence relation.

Thus, the maximal constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( n \geq 5 \) is:

\[
\boxed{C = \frac{1}{5}}.
\]

The answer is \( C = \frac{1}{5} \). 

Final answer format:

The answer is \( C = \frac{1}{5} \).
