Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1 + 5abcd.
\]

We need to analyze the expression:

\[
a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2
\]

and determine its relationship to \(\frac{3}{5}\).

### Step 1: Analyze the given condition

From the equation \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1 + 5abcd\), we can rearrange it to:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 - 5abcd = 1.
\]

This suggests a relationship between the sum of squares of \(a, b, c, d\) and the product \(abcd\).

### Step 2: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the terms \(a^2, 3b^2, 2c^2, d^2\). We can express the inequality as follows:

\[
(a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2)(1 + 1 + 1 + 1) \geq (a + \sqrt{3}b + \sqrt{2}c + d)^2.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4(a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2) \geq (a + \sqrt{3}b + \sqrt{2}c + d)^2.
\]

### Step 3: Bound the right-hand side

To find a bound for \(a + \sqrt{3}b + \sqrt{2}c + d\), we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again:

\[
(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)(1^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2 + (\sqrt{2})^2 + 1^2) \geq (a + \sqrt{3}b + \sqrt{2}c + d)^2.
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
1^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2 + (\sqrt{2})^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 7.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) \cdot 7 \geq (a + \sqrt{3}b + \sqrt{2}c + d)^2.
\]

### Step 4: Substitute the condition

Using the condition \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1 + 5abcd\), we can substitute this into our inequality:

\[
7(1 + 5abcd) \geq (a + \sqrt{3}b + \sqrt{2}c + d)^2.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the expression \(a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2\)

We need to find a lower bound for \(a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2\). We can express it in terms of \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2\):

\[
a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2 = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) + 2b^2 + c^2.
\]

Since \(b^2\) and \(c^2\) are non-negative, we have:

\[
a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2 \geq a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1 + 5abcd.
\]

### Step 6: Compare with \(\frac{3}{5}\)

To determine the relationship with \(\frac{3}{5}\), we need to analyze the maximum possible value of \(a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2\). 

Given that \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \leq 1\) (since \(abcd\) is maximized when \(a, b, c, d\) are equal), we can conclude that:

\[
a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2 \leq 1 + 2b^2 + c^2 \leq 1 + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = 1.75.
\]

Since \(1.75 > \frac{3}{5}\), we can conclude that:

\[
a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2 \geq \frac{3}{5}.
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

\[
\boxed{\geq}.
\]

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
