    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality \n\n\\[\na + \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \\geq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all non-negative real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) with \\( a \\geq b \\geq 0 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the expression\n\nWe can rewrite the inequality as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \\geq C - a.\n\\]\n\nThis implies that we need to analyze the behavior of \\( \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \\) as \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) vary.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the case when \\( b \\) approaches 0\n\nIf \\( b = 0 \\), the term \\( \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \\) becomes undefined. Therefore, we need to consider the limit as \\( b \\) approaches 0. \n\nLet \\( b \\) be a small positive number. Then, as \\( b \\to 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \\to \\infty.\n\\]\n\nThis means that for any fixed \\( a \\), as \\( b \\) approaches 0, the left-hand side of the inequality can become arbitrarily large. Thus, we cannot determine \\( C \\) from this case.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the case when \\( a = b \\)\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider the case when \\( a = b \\). In this case, we have:\n\n\\[\na + \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} = a + \\frac{1}{b(0)}.\n\\]\n\nThis is again undefined. Therefore, we need to consider \\( a > b \\).\n\n### Step 4: Consider \\( a = b + \\epsilon \\) for small \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\)\n\nLet \\( a = b + \\epsilon \\) where \\( \\epsilon \\) is a small positive number. Then we have:\n\n\\[\na - b = \\epsilon,\n\\]\n\nand the inequality becomes:\n\n\\[\n(b + \\epsilon) + \\frac{1}{b \\epsilon} \\geq C.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the limit as \\( \\epsilon \\to 0 \\)\n\nAs \\( \\epsilon \\to 0 \\), the term \\( \\frac{1}{b \\epsilon} \\) dominates. Thus, we can analyze the limit:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\left( b + \\epsilon + \\frac{1}{b \\epsilon} \\right).\n\\]\n\nFor fixed \\( b > 0 \\), as \\( \\epsilon \\to 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{b \\epsilon} \\to \\infty.\n\\]\n\nThis means that the left-hand side can also become arbitrarily large.\n\n### Step 6: Find a lower bound for \\( C \\)\n\nTo find a lower bound for \\( C \\), we can consider specific values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). \n\nLet\u2019s set \\( b = 1 \\) and \\( a = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{1(1-1)} \\text{ is undefined.}\n\\]\n\nNow let\u2019s try \\( b = 1 \\) and \\( a = 2 \\):\n\n\\[\n2 + \\frac{1}{1(2-1)} = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\\]\n\nNext, let\u2019s try \\( b = 2 \\) and \\( a = 3 \\):\n\n\\[\n3 + \\frac{1}{2(3-2)} = 3 + \\frac{1}{2} = 3.5.\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: General case\n\nTo find the largest constant \\( C \\), we can see that as \\( b \\) increases, the term \\( \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \\) decreases. Therefore, we can conclude that the minimum value of \\( a + \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \\) occurs when \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are equal, which leads to undefined behavior.\n\nHowever, we can see that the minimum value we can achieve is when \\( a \\) is just slightly greater than \\( b \\). \n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter testing various values, we find that the minimum value of \\( a + \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \\) approaches 3 as \\( b \\) approaches 1 and \\( a \\) approaches 2. Thus, the largest constant \\( C \\) that satisfies the inequality for all \\( a \\geq b \\geq 0 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nC = 3.\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The answer is } C=3.\n\\]",
