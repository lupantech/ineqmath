Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
a(b-c)^4 + b(a-c)^4 + c(a-b)^4 \quad () \quad 0,
\]

we will analyze the expression on the left-hand side.

### Step 1: Analyze the expression

The terms \( (b-c)^4 \), \( (a-c)^4 \), and \( (a-b)^4 \) are all non-negative for any real numbers \( a, b, c \). This is because raising any real number to an even power results in a non-negative value. Therefore, we can conclude that:

\[
a(b-c)^4 \geq 0, \quad b(a-c)^4 \geq 0, \quad c(a-b)^4 \geq 0.
\]

### Step 2: Consider cases

1. **Case 1: All variables are equal**  
   If \( a = b = c \), then \( (b-c)^4 = (a-c)^4 = (a-b)^4 = 0 \). Thus, the left-hand side becomes:

   \[
   a(0) + b(0) + c(0) = 0.
   \]

   In this case, the inequality holds as an equality:

   \[
   0 \quad () \quad 0.
   \]

2. **Case 2: At least one variable is different**  
   If at least one of \( a, b, c \) is different, then at least one of the terms \( (b-c)^4 \), \( (a-c)^4 \), or \( (a-b)^4 \) will be positive. Consequently, the entire expression \( a(b-c)^4 + b(a-c)^4 + c(a-b)^4 \) will be positive, provided that \( a, b, c \) are non-negative.

### Step 3: Conclusion

From the analysis, we can conclude that:

- If \( a = b = c \), the expression equals \( 0 \).
- If \( a, b, c \) are not all equal, the expression is strictly greater than \( 0 \).

Thus, we can fill in the blank in the inequality as follows:

\[
a(b-c)^4 + b(a-c)^4 + c(a-b)^4 \geq 0.
\]

Since the expression can equal \( 0 \) when \( a = b = c \) and is positive otherwise, the correct relation to fill in the blank is:

\[
\geq.
\]

### Final Answer

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
