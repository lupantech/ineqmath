Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition for the cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\):

\[
AB \cdot BC = 2AD \cdot DC.
\]

We need to analyze the inequality:

\[
8BD^2 \quad () \quad 9AC^2.
\]

### Step 1: Use the Law of Cosines

In a cyclic quadrilateral, we can apply the Law of Cosines. For triangles \(ABD\) and \(ACD\), we have:

1. For triangle \(ABD\):
   \[
   AB^2 + AD^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AD \cdot \cos(\angle ADB) = BD^2.
   \]

2. For triangle \(ACD\):
   \[
   AC^2 + AD^2 - 2 \cdot AC \cdot AD \cdot \cos(\angle ACD) = DC^2.
   \]

### Step 2: Relate \(BD^2\) and \(AC^2\)

Using the given condition \(AB \cdot BC = 2AD \cdot DC\), we can express \(BD\) and \(AC\) in terms of the sides of the quadrilateral. 

Let \(AB = c\), \(BC = a\), \(AD = d\), and \(DC = b\). Then we have:

\[
c \cdot a = 2d \cdot b.
\]

### Step 3: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to relate \(BD^2\) and \(AC^2\). 

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form:

\[
(AB^2 + AD^2)(BC^2 + DC^2) \geq (AB \cdot BC + AD \cdot DC)^2,
\]

we can express \(BD^2\) and \(AC^2\) in terms of \(AB\), \(AD\), \(BC\), and \(DC\).

### Step 4: Analyze the Inequality

From the condition \(AB \cdot BC = 2AD \cdot DC\), we can derive that:

\[
\frac{AB \cdot BC}{AD \cdot DC} = 2.
\]

This suggests that the product of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) can be related through the sides of the quadrilateral. 

### Step 5: Compare \(8BD^2\) and \(9AC^2\)

To compare \(8BD^2\) and \(9AC^2\), we can use the derived relationships and inequalities. 

Given the cyclic nature and the relationships established, we can conclude that:

\[
8BD^2 < 9AC^2.
\]

This is because the cyclic nature and the given condition imply that the product of the diagonals is less than the square of the sides multiplied by a constant factor.

### Conclusion

Thus, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

\[
8BD^2 < 9AC^2.
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
