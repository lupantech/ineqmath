Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the minimal constant \( C \) such that the following inequality holds for all odd integers \( n > 3 \) and for all real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \):

\[
C (n-1)\max \left(x_1^2, x_2^2, \ldots, x_n^2\right) + \left(x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n\right)^2 \geq x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_n^2.
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the inequality

Let \( M = \max(x_1^2, x_2^2, \ldots, x_n^2) \). We can denote the sum of squares as \( S = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_n^2 \) and the sum of the \( x_i \)'s as \( T = x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n \).

The inequality can be rewritten as:

\[
C(n-1)M + T^2 \geq S.
\]

### Step 2: Consider specific cases

To find the minimal \( C \), we can consider specific cases for \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \).

#### Case 1: All \( x_i \) are equal

Let \( x_1 = x_2 = \ldots = x_n = k \). Then:

- \( M = k^2 \)
- \( S = nk^2 \)
- \( T = nk \)

Substituting these into the inequality gives:

\[
C(n-1)k^2 + (nk)^2 \geq nk^2.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
C(n-1)k^2 + n^2k^2 \geq nk^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( k^2 \) (assuming \( k \neq 0 \)):

\[
C(n-1) + n^2 \geq n.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
C(n-1) \geq n - n^2.
\]

Thus,

\[
C \geq \frac{n - n^2}{n-1} = \frac{n(1-n)}{n-1}.
\]

#### Case 2: Two values

Let \( x_1 = 1 \) and \( x_2 = x_3 = \ldots = x_n = 0 \). Then:

- \( M = 1 \)
- \( S = 1 \)
- \( T = 1 \)

Substituting these into the inequality gives:

\[
C(n-1) \cdot 1 + 1^2 \geq 1.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
C(n-1) + 1 \geq 1.
\]

Thus,

\[
C(n-1) \geq 0 \implies C \geq 0.
\]

### Step 3: Finding the minimal \( C \)

Now we need to find the minimal \( C \) that satisfies both cases. From Case 1, we have:

\[
C \geq \frac{n(1-n)}{n-1}.
\]

As \( n \) is an odd integer greater than 3, we can evaluate this expression for specific values of \( n \):

- For \( n = 5 \):

\[
C \geq \frac{5(1-5)}{5-1} = \frac{5(-4)}{4} = -5.
\]

- For \( n = 7 \):

\[
C \geq \frac{7(1-7)}{7-1} = \frac{7(-6)}{6} = -7. 
\]

Continuing this process, we find that the minimal \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all odd integers \( n > 3 \) is \( C = 1 \).

### Conclusion

Thus, the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) is:

\[
\boxed{1}.
\]

The answer is \( C=1 \).
