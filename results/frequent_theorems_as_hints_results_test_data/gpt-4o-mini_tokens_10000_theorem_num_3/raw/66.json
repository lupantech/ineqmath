    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the geometry of the isosceles triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with \\( \\overline{AB} = \\overline{AC} \\) and the tangents to the circumcircle at points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) intersecting at point \\( D \\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**:\n   - Let \\( O \\) be the circumcenter of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n   - The angles \\( \\angle DAB \\) and \\( \\angle DBA \\) are equal because \\( D \\) lies on the tangents to the circumcircle at points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). Thus, \\( \\angle DAB = \\angle DBA = \\theta \\).\n   - The angle \\( \\angle AOB \\) is the central angle corresponding to arc \\( AB \\) in the circumcircle.\n\n2. **Relating Angles**:\n   - The angle \\( \\angle ACB \\) is the inscribed angle that subtends arc \\( AB \\), so we have:\n     \\[\n     \\angle ACB = \\frac{1}{2} \\angle AOB.\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( \\triangle ABC \\) is isosceles, we denote \\( \\angle ABC = \\angle ACB = x \\). Therefore, \\( \\angle AOB = 2x \\).\n\n3. **Finding \\( \\angle DCB \\)**:\n   - The angle \\( \\angle DCB \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( \\theta \\) and \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     \\angle DCB = 180^\\circ - \\angle DAB - \\angle ACB = 180^\\circ - \\theta - x.\n     \\]\n   - We also know that \\( \\theta = 90^\\circ - x \\) because the tangents at points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) create right angles with the radii \\( OA \\) and \\( OB \\) at those points.\n\n4. **Substituting for \\( \\theta \\)**:\n   - Substituting \\( \\theta \\) into the expression for \\( \\angle DCB \\):\n     \\[\n     \\angle DCB = 180^\\circ - (90^\\circ - x) - x = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ + x - x = 90^\\circ.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \\( \\angle DCB \\) is always \\( 90^\\circ \\) for any isosceles triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\), we conclude that the maximum value of \\( \\angle DCB \\) is \\( 90^\\circ \\).\n   - Therefore, the minimal constant \\( C \\) such that \\( \\angle DCB \\leq C \\) for all such triangles is \\( C = 90^\\circ \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{The answer is } C=90.\n\\]",
