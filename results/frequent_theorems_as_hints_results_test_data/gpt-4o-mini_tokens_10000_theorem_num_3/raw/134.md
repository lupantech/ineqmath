Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
d_a \cdot h_a^2 + d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \quad () \quad (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3,
\]

we will apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

Let us denote:

- \( a_1 = d_a \), \( a_2 = d_b \), \( a_3 = d_c \)
- \( b_1 = h_a^2 \), \( b_2 = h_b^2 \), \( b_3 = h_c^2 \)

According to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
\left( d_a \cdot h_a^2 + d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \right) \left( d_a + d_b + d_c \right) \geq \left( d_a + d_b + d_c \right)^2.
\]

Rearranging this gives:

\[
d_a \cdot h_a^2 + d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \geq \frac{(d_a + d_b + d_c)^2}{(h_a^2 + h_b^2 + h_c^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to relate \( h_a^2 + h_b^2 + h_c^2 \) to \( (d_a + d_b + d_c) \). 

Using the fact that the area \( A \) of triangle \( ABC \) can be expressed in terms of the altitudes and the corresponding bases:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} a h_a = \frac{1}{2} b h_b = \frac{1}{2} c h_c,
\]

where \( a, b, c \) are the lengths of the sides opposite to vertices \( A, B, C \) respectively. 

The distances \( d_a, d_b, d_c \) from point \( P \) to the sides of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the area \( A \) as follows:

\[
d_a = \frac{2A}{a}, \quad d_b = \frac{2A}{b}, \quad d_c = \frac{2A}{c}.
\]

Thus, we can express \( d_a + d_b + d_c \) as:

\[
d_a + d_b + d_c = \frac{2A}{a} + \frac{2A}{b} + \frac{2A}{c} = 2A \left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \right).
\]

Now, we can analyze the left-hand side of our original inequality. The terms \( d_a \cdot h_a^2, d_b \cdot h_b^2, d_c \cdot h_c^2 \) can be interpreted in terms of the area and the sides of the triangle. 

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again, we can show that:

\[
d_a \cdot h_a^2 + d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \leq (d_a + d_b + d_c) \cdot \frac{h_a^2 + h_b^2 + h_c^2}{3}.
\]

However, we need to compare this with \( (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3 \). 

To finalize our analysis, we can apply the Power Mean inequality or the AM-GM inequality to show that:

\[
\frac{(d_a + d_b + d_c)^2}{(h_a^2 + h_b^2 + h_c^2)} \leq (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3,
\]

which leads us to conclude that:

\[
d_a \cdot h_a^2 + d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \leq (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3.
\]

Thus, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

\[
\leq.
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is (A) $\leq$.
