## Query

Task description: Please solve the problem with clear, rigorous, and logically sound steps. At the end of your response, state your answer in exactly this format: 'The answer is $C=X$', where X is your calculated numerical bound value. Example: 'The answer is $C=1$'.

Here are some example problems and solutions that are related to the problem you are solving:

Example Problem 1: Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths, $h_{a}, h_{b}, h_{c}$ be the altitudes, respectively, and $r$ be the inradius of a triangle. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all triangles:
$$
\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq C \cdot r
$$
Solution of Example Problem 1: By $\frac{1}{h_{a}}+\frac{1}{h_{b}}+\frac{1}{h_{c}}=\frac{1}{r}$ we obtain
$$
\frac{h_{a}-2 r}{h_{a}}+\frac{h_{b}-2 r}{h_{b}}+\frac{h_{c}-2 r}{h_{c}}=1
$$

Applying $A M \geq H M$ we get
$$
\left(\frac{h_{a}-2 r}{h_{a}}+\frac{h_{b}-2 r}{h_{b}}+\frac{h_{c}-2 r}{h_{c}}\right)\left(\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r}\right) \geq 9
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq 9
$$

Therefore
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{2 r}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{2 r}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{2 r}{h_{c}-2 r} \\
& \quad=\frac{h_{a}-\left(h_{a}-2 r\right)}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}-\left(h_{b}-2 r\right)}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}-\left(h_{c}-2 r\right)}{h_{c}-2 r} \\
& \quad=\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r}-3 \geq 9-3=6
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq \frac{3}{r}
$$
Answer of Example Problem 1: $$C = 3$$

Example Problem 2: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3abc$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{a}{b^2 c^2} + \frac{b}{c^2 a^2} + \frac{c}{a^2 b^2} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c}
$$
Solution of Example Problem 2: The given inequality is equivalent to
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq 9 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}
$$

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2}
$$

Since $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}=3 a b c$ we obtain
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2}=(3 a b c)^{2}=9 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}
$$

Equality holds if and only if $a=b=c=1$.
Answer of Example Problem 2: $$C = 9$$

Example Problem 3: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a b c = 1$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{b+c}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{c+a}{\sqrt{b}}+\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{c}} \geq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+C
$$
Solution of Example Problem 3: [Solution 1]
From the AM-GM Inequality, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{c+a}{\sqrt{b}}+\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{c}} \geq 2\left(\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}+\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}+\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}\right)= \\
& =\left(\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}+\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}\right)+\left(\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}+\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}\right)+\left(\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}+\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}\right) \geq \\
& \geq 2(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}) \geq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+3 \sqrt[6]{a b c}=\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+3 .
\end{aligned}

Problem: Let $\left(a_n\right)_{n \geq 0}$ be a sequence of real numbers such that for all $n \geq 0$,

$$
a_{n+1} \geq a_n^2 + \frac{1}{5}
$$

Determine the maximal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $n \geq 5$:

$$
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq a_{n-5}^2 + C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the recursive inequality given for the sequence \( (a_n)_{n \geq 0} \):

\[
a_{n+1} \geq a_n^2 + \frac{1}{5}.
\]

We will analyze the behavior of the sequence \( a_n \) and derive a bound for \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq a_{n-5}^2 + C
\]

holds for all \( n \geq 5 \).

### Step 1: Establish a lower bound for \( a_n \)

We can use the recursive definition to find a lower bound for \( a_n \). Starting from an initial value \( a_0 \), we can express subsequent terms:

\[
a_1 \geq a_0^2 + \frac{1}{5},
\]
\[
a_2 \geq a_1^2 + \frac{1}{5} \geq (a_0^2 + \frac{1}{5})^2 + \frac{1}{5}.
\]

Continuing this process, we can see that \( a_n \) grows at least quadratically. To analyze the growth more systematically, we can assume \( a_n \) is bounded below by a function of \( n \).

### Step 2: Assume a form for \( a_n \)

Letâ€™s assume \( a_n \) grows without bound. We can hypothesize that \( a_n \) behaves like \( n \) for large \( n \). We will show that this assumption leads to a contradiction unless \( C \) is appropriately bounded.

### Step 3: Analyze the inequality

We need to analyze the inequality:

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq a_{n-5}^2 + C.
\]

Using the recursive definition, we can express \( a_{n+5} \) in terms of \( a_n \):

\[
a_{n+5} \geq a_{n+4}^2 + \frac{1}{5} \geq (a_{n+3}^2 + \frac{1}{5})^2 + \frac{1}{5} \geq \ldots \geq a_n^{2^5} + \text{(lower order terms)}.
\]

### Step 4: Establish a relationship

We can see that \( a_{n+5} \) grows significantly larger than \( a_{n-5}^2 \) as \( n \) increases. Specifically, if we assume \( a_n \) grows at least linearly, we can write:

\[
a_n \geq n.
\]

Then,

\[
a_{n-5}^2 \geq (n-5)^2 = n^2 - 10n + 25.
\]

### Step 5: Find \( C \)

Now we need to find \( C \) such that:

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq n^2 - 10n + 25 + C.
\]

Assuming \( a_{n+5} \) grows like \( n^2 \), we have:

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq n.
\]

Thus, we need:

\[
n \geq n^2 - 10n + 25 + C.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
0 \geq n^2 - 11n + 25 + C.
\]

This is a quadratic inequality in \( n \). The discriminant must be non-positive for the inequality to hold for all \( n \):

\[
(-11)^2 - 4(1)(25 + C) \leq 0.
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
121 - 100 - 4C \leq 0 \implies 21 \leq 4C \implies C \geq \frac{21}{4} = 5.25.
\]

### Conclusion

To find the maximal constant \( C \), we can take \( C = 5 \) as the largest integer satisfying the inequality. Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( n \geq 5 \) is:

\[
\boxed{5}.
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is \( C=5 \).
