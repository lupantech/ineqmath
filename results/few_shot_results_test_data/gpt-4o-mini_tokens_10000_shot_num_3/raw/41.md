Problem: Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths, $h_{a}, h_{b}, h_{c}$ be the altitudes, respectively, and $r$ be the inradius of a triangle. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all triangles:
$$
\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq C \cdot r
$$

Solution: By $\frac{1}{h_{a}}+\frac{1}{h_{b}}+\frac{1}{h_{c}}=\frac{1}{r}$ we obtain
$$
\frac{h_{a}-2 r}{h_{a}}+\frac{h_{b}-2 r}{h_{b}}+\frac{h_{c}-2 r}{h_{c}}=1
$$

Applying $A M \geq H M$ we get
$$
\left(\frac{h_{a}-2 r}{h_{a}}+\frac{h_{b}-2 r}{h_{b}}+\frac{h_{c}-2 r}{h_{c}}\right)\left(\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r}\right) \geq 9
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq 9
$$

Therefore
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{2 r}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{2 r}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{2 r}{h_{c}-2 r} \\
& \quad=\frac{h_{a}-\left(h_{a}-2 r\right)}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}-\left(h_{b}-2 r\right)}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}-\left(h_{c}-2 r\right)}{h_{c}-2 r} \\
& \quad=\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r}-3 \geq 9-3=6
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq \frac{3}{r}
$$



Problem: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3abc$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{a}{b^2 c^2} + \frac{b}{c^2 a^2} + \frac{c}{a^2 b^2} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c}
$$

Solution: The given inequality is equivalent to
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq 9 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}
$$

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2}
$$

Since $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}=3 a b c$ we obtain
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2}=(3 a b c)^{2}=9 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}
$$

Equality holds if and only if $a=b=c=1$.



Problem: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a b c = 1$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{b+c}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{c+a}{\sqrt{b}}+\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{c}} \geq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+C
$$

Solution: [Solution 1]
From the AM-GM Inequality, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{c+a}{\sqrt{b}}+\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{c}} \geq 2\left(\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}+\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}+\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}\right)= \\
& =\left(\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}+\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}\right)+\left(\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}+\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}\right)+\left(\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}+\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}\right) \geq \\
& \geq 2(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}) \geq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+3 \sqrt[6]{a b c}=\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+3 .
\end{aligned}
$$

Problem: Let $\left(a_n\right)_{n \geq 0}$ be a sequence of real numbers such that for all $n \geq 0$,

$$
a_{n+1} \geq a_n^2 + \frac{1}{5}
$$

Determine the maximal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $n \geq 5$:

$$
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq a_{n-5}^2 + C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the recurrence relation given for the sequence \( (a_n)_{n \geq 0} \):

\[
a_{n+1} \geq a_n^2 + \frac{1}{5}.
\]

We will analyze the growth of the sequence \( a_n \) and derive a bound for \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq a_{n-5}^2 + C
\]

holds for all \( n \geq 5 \).

### Step 1: Establishing a lower bound for \( a_n \)

We can use the recurrence relation to find a lower bound for \( a_n \). Starting from an initial value \( a_0 \), we can express subsequent terms:

\[
a_1 \geq a_0^2 + \frac{1}{5},
\]
\[
a_2 \geq a_1^2 + \frac{1}{5} \geq (a_0^2 + \frac{1}{5})^2 + \frac{1}{5}.
\]

Continuing this process, we can see that \( a_n \) grows at least quadratically. To analyze the growth more systematically, we can assume \( a_n \) is bounded below by a function of the form \( b_n = \frac{1}{5} \cdot 2^n \) for large \( n \). This assumption is based on the fact that each term adds a positive quantity, leading to exponential growth.

### Step 2: Finding \( a_{n+5} \)

Using the recurrence relation, we can express \( a_{n+5} \) in terms of \( a_n \):

\[
a_{n+5} \geq a_{n+4}^2 + \frac{1}{5} \geq (a_{n+3}^2 + \frac{1}{5})^2 + \frac{1}{5} \geq \ldots
\]

This shows that \( a_{n+5} \) is significantly larger than \( a_n^2 \) for large \( n \).

### Step 3: Establishing the inequality

Now we need to establish the inequality:

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq a_{n-5}^2 + C.
\]

Assuming \( a_n \) grows sufficiently fast, we can estimate:

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq \sqrt{(a_{n-5}^2 + \frac{1}{5})^2 + \frac{1}{5}}.
\]

For large \( n \), we can approximate \( a_{n-5} \) as being large, leading to:

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \approx a_{n-5} + \text{(small terms)}.
\]

### Step 4: Finding the constant \( C \)

To satisfy the inequality, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that:

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq a_{n-5}^2 + C.
\]

Given the growth of \( a_n \), we can see that \( C \) must be a small positive constant. Testing with \( C = \frac{1}{5} \) gives:

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} \geq a_{n-5}^2 + \frac{1}{5}.
\]

This holds true as \( a_n \) grows rapidly. 

### Conclusion

After analyzing the growth of the sequence and the implications of the recurrence relation, we conclude that the largest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all \( n \geq 5 \) is:

\[
\boxed{C = \frac{1}{5}}.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is \( C = \frac{1}{5} \).
