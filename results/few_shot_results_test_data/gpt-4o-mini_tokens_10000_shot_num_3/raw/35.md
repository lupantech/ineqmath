Problem: Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths, $h_{a}, h_{b}, h_{c}$ be the altitudes, respectively, and $r$ be the inradius of a triangle. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all triangles:
$$
\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq C \cdot r
$$

Solution: By $\frac{1}{h_{a}}+\frac{1}{h_{b}}+\frac{1}{h_{c}}=\frac{1}{r}$ we obtain
$$
\frac{h_{a}-2 r}{h_{a}}+\frac{h_{b}-2 r}{h_{b}}+\frac{h_{c}-2 r}{h_{c}}=1
$$

Applying $A M \geq H M$ we get
$$
\left(\frac{h_{a}-2 r}{h_{a}}+\frac{h_{b}-2 r}{h_{b}}+\frac{h_{c}-2 r}{h_{c}}\right)\left(\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r}\right) \geq 9
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq 9
$$

Therefore
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{2 r}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{2 r}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{2 r}{h_{c}-2 r} \\
& \quad=\frac{h_{a}-\left(h_{a}-2 r\right)}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}-\left(h_{b}-2 r\right)}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}-\left(h_{c}-2 r\right)}{h_{c}-2 r} \\
& \quad=\frac{h_{a}}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{h_{b}}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{h_{c}}{h_{c}-2 r}-3 \geq 9-3=6
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{1}{h_{a}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{b}-2 r}+\frac{1}{h_{c}-2 r} \geq \frac{3}{r}
$$



Problem: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3abc$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{a}{b^2 c^2} + \frac{b}{c^2 a^2} + \frac{c}{a^2 b^2} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c}
$$

Solution: The given inequality is equivalent to
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq 9 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}
$$

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2}
$$

Since $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}=3 a b c$ we obtain
$$
\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)(a+b+c) \geq\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2}=(3 a b c)^{2}=9 a^{2} b^{2} c^{2}
$$

Equality holds if and only if $a=b=c=1$.



Problem: Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a b c = 1$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{b+c}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{c+a}{\sqrt{b}}+\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{c}} \geq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+C
$$

Solution: [Solution 1]
From the AM-GM Inequality, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{c+a}{\sqrt{b}}+\frac{a+b}{\sqrt{c}} \geq 2\left(\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}+\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}+\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}\right)= \\
& =\left(\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}+\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}\right)+\left(\sqrt{\frac{c a}{b}}+\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}\right)+\left(\sqrt{\frac{a b}{c}}+\sqrt{\frac{b c}{a}}\right) \geq \\
& \geq 2(\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}) \geq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+3 \sqrt[6]{a b c}=\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+3 .
\end{aligned}

$$
d_a \cdot h_a^2 + d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \geq C \cdot (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3
$$

where $h_a, h_b, h_c$ are the altitudes of the triangle.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality given:

\[
d_a \cdot h_a^2 + d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \geq C \cdot (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3
\]

where \(d_a, d_b, d_c\) are the distances from point \(P\) to the sides of triangle \(ABC\), and \(h_a, h_b, h_c\) are the corresponding altitudes from vertices \(A, B, C\) to the opposite sides.

### Step 1: Understanding the Terms

1. **Distances \(d_a, d_b, d_c\)**: These are the perpendicular distances from point \(P\) to the sides \(BC, CA, AB\) respectively.
2. **Altitudes \(h_a, h_b, h_c\)**: These are the lengths of the perpendiculars dropped from vertices \(A, B, C\) to the opposite sides.

### Step 2: Applying Known Inequalities

We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to relate the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the inequality. By Cauchy-Schwarz, we have:

\[
(d_a + d_b + d_c)(h_a^2 + h_b^2 + h_c^2) \geq (d_a h_a + d_b h_b + d_c h_c)^2
\]

### Step 3: Relating Altitudes and Distances

The altitudes \(h_a, h_b, h_c\) can be expressed in terms of the area \(A\) of triangle \(ABC\) and the side lengths \(a, b, c\):

\[
h_a = \frac{2A}{a}, \quad h_b = \frac{2A}{b}, \quad h_c = \frac{2A}{c}
\]

### Step 4: Finding the Constant \(C\)

To find the largest constant \(C\), we can analyze the case when \(P\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). In this case, the distances \(d_a, d_b, d_c\) are equal, and we denote them as \(d\). The altitudes can also be expressed in terms of the area and the sides.

Assuming \(d_a = d_b = d_c = d\), we have:

\[
d_a + d_b + d_c = 3d
\]

Substituting into the inequality gives:

\[
d(h_a^2 + h_b^2 + h_c^2) \geq C \cdot (3d)^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
h_a^2 + h_b^2 + h_c^2 \geq 27C d^2
\]

### Step 5: Finding the Maximum \(C\)

To maximize \(C\), we need to find the minimum value of \(h_a^2 + h_b^2 + h_c^2\) in terms of \(d\). By the properties of triangles and the fact that the altitudes are related to the area, we can derive that:

\[
h_a^2 + h_b^2 + h_c^2 \geq \frac{3}{2} (h_a + h_b + h_c)^2
\]

Using the fact that the area \(A\) is maximized for a given perimeter when the triangle is equilateral, we can find that:

\[
C = \frac{1}{9}
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \(C\) such that the inequality holds for all points \(P\) inside triangle \(ABC\) is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C = \frac{1}{9}
\]
