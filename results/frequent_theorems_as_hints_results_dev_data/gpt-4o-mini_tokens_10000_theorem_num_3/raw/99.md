Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression 

\[
S = \frac{1}{1+a^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+b)} + \frac{1}{1+c^2}
\]

under the constraint \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1 \) where \( a, b, c \geq 0 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the terms in \( S \)

1. **First term**: \( \frac{1}{1+a^2} \)
   - This term decreases as \( a^2 \) increases. The maximum value occurs when \( a = 0 \), giving \( \frac{1}{1+0} = 1 \).

2. **Second term**: \( \frac{1}{3(1+b)} \)
   - This term decreases as \( b \) increases. The maximum value occurs when \( b = 0 \), giving \( \frac{1}{3(1+0)} = \frac{1}{3} \).

3. **Third term**: \( \frac{1}{1+c^2} \)
   - Similar to the first term, this term decreases as \( c^2 \) increases. The maximum value occurs when \( c = 0 \), giving \( \frac{1}{1+0} = 1 \).

### Step 2: Find the maximum of \( S \)

To maximize \( S \), we should minimize \( a^2 \), \( b \), and \( c^2 \) under the constraint \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1 \). 

- If we set \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c^2 = 1 \) (thus \( c = 1 \)), we have:
  \[
  S = \frac{1}{1+0} + \frac{1}{3(1+0)} + \frac{1}{1+1} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2}
  \]

Calculating this:
\[
S = 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{3}{6} = 1 + \frac{5}{6} = \frac{11}{6}
\]

### Step 3: Compare \( S \) with \( \frac{7}{4} \)

Now we need to compare \( \frac{11}{6} \) with \( \frac{7}{4} \).

To do this, we can convert both fractions to a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 4 is 12.

- Convert \( \frac{11}{6} \):
\[
\frac{11}{6} = \frac{11 \times 2}{6 \times 2} = \frac{22}{12}
\]

- Convert \( \frac{7}{4} \):
\[
\frac{7}{4} = \frac{7 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{21}{12}
\]

### Step 4: Compare the two results

Now we compare:
\[
\frac{22}{12} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{21}{12}
\]

Since \( 22 > 21 \), we have:
\[
\frac{11}{6} > \frac{7}{4}
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
S > \frac{7}{4}
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (E) $>$.
