Problem: Find the smallest constant $C$ such that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, the following inequality holds:
$$
x^2 + x + y^2 + y + C \geq x y
$$

Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
x^2 + x + y^2 + y + C \geq xy
\]

holds for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we can rearrange the inequality as follows:

\[
x^2 - xy + y^2 + x + y + C \geq 0.
\]

This is a quadratic inequality in terms of \( x \):

\[
x^2 - (y-1)x + (y^2 + y + C) \geq 0.
\]

For this quadratic to be non-negative for all \( x \), the discriminant must be non-positive. The discriminant \( D \) of the quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by \( D = b^2 - 4ac \). Here, we have:

- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = -(y-1) \)
- \( c = y^2 + y + C \)

Thus, the discriminant is:

\[
D = (-(y-1))^2 - 4(1)(y^2 + y + C) = (y-1)^2 - 4(y^2 + y + C).
\]

Expanding this, we get:

\[
D = (y^2 - 2y + 1) - 4y^2 - 4y - 4C = -3y^2 - 6y + 1 - 4C.
\]

For the quadratic to be non-negative for all \( x \), we require:

\[
-3y^2 - 6y + 1 - 4C \leq 0.
\]

This is a quadratic in \( y \) and must be non-positive for all \( y \). The condition for a quadratic \( ay^2 + by + c \leq 0 \) for all \( y \) is that \( a \leq 0 \) and the discriminant must be non-positive. Here, \( a = -3 \), which is indeed less than 0.

Next, we need to ensure that the discriminant of this quadratic is non-positive:

\[
D' = (-6)^2 - 4(-3)(1 - 4C) = 36 + 12(1 - 4C).
\]

Setting the discriminant \( D' \leq 0 \):

\[
36 + 12(1 - 4C) \leq 0.
\]

Simplifying this gives:

\[
36 + 12 - 48C \leq 0 \implies 48C \geq 48 \implies C \geq 1.
\]

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all \( x \) and \( y \) is \( C = 1 \).

Finally, we conclude:

The answer is \( C=1 \).
