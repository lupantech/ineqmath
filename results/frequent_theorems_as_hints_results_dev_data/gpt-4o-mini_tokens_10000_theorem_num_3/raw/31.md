$$

Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
7(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a) \geq C a b c d
\]

holds for all non-negative real numbers \( a, b, c, d \) satisfying \( a \geq b + 7c + d \).

### Step 1: Analyze the inequality

We start by rewriting the left-hand side:

\[
7(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a)
\]

We will analyze this expression under the constraint \( a \geq b + 7c + d \).

### Step 2: Consider specific cases

To find the largest \( C \), we can test specific values of \( a, b, c, d \) that satisfy the constraint. 

#### Case 1: Let \( b = c = d = 0 \)

In this case, the constraint simplifies to \( a \geq 0 \). The left-hand side becomes:

\[
7(a+0)(0+0)(0+0)(0+a) = 0
\]

The right-hand side becomes:

\[
C \cdot a \cdot 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 = 0
\]

This case does not provide any information about \( C \).

#### Case 2: Let \( b = 0, c = 0, d = 1 \)

Now, the constraint becomes \( a \geq 0 + 7 \cdot 0 + 1 \), or \( a \geq 1 \). The left-hand side becomes:

\[
7(a+0)(0+0)(0+1)(1+a) = 7a(1+a) = 7a + 7a^2
\]

The right-hand side becomes:

\[
C \cdot a \cdot 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 1 = 0
\]

Again, this case does not provide information about \( C \).

#### Case 3: Let \( b = 1, c = 1, d = 1 \)

Now, the constraint becomes \( a \geq 1 + 7 \cdot 1 + 1 = 9 \). The left-hand side becomes:

\[
7(a+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+a) = 7(a+1)(2)(2)(a+1) = 28(a+1)^2
\]

The right-hand side becomes:

\[
C \cdot a \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = C a
\]

Thus, we need:

\[
28(a+1)^2 \geq C a
\]

### Step 3: Find the largest \( C \)

To find the largest \( C \), we can analyze the inequality:

\[
28(a+1)^2 \geq C a
\]

Dividing both sides by \( a \) (valid since \( a \geq 9 > 0 \)) gives:

\[
28 \left( \frac{(a+1)^2}{a} \right) \geq C
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
28 \left( \frac{a^2 + 2a + 1}{a} \right) = 28 \left( a + 2 + \frac{1}{a} \right)
\]

As \( a \to \infty \), \( \frac{1}{a} \to 0 \), and thus:

\[
28(a + 2 + \frac{1}{a}) \to 28a + 56
\]

The term \( 28a \) dominates, and we can find the limit as \( a \) approaches infinity. However, we need to find the minimum value of \( 28(a + 2 + \frac{1}{a}) \) for \( a \geq 9 \).

Calculating at \( a = 9 \):

\[
28(9 + 2 + \frac{1}{9}) = 28(11 + \frac{1}{9}) = 28 \cdot \frac{100}{9} = \frac{2800}{9}
\]

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all valid \( a, b, c, d \) is:

\[
C = \frac{2800}{9}
\]

### Conclusion

The answer is \( C = \frac{2800}{9} \).

Thus, we state:

The answer is \( C = \frac{2800}{9} \).
