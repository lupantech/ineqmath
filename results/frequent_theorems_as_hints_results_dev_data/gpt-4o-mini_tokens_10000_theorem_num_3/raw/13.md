Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression 

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right)
\]

given the constraint \(x + y = 1\). We can rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) = \left(1 + \frac{y}{xy}\right)\left(1 + \frac{x}{xy}\right) = \left(1 + \frac{1 - x}{x(1-x)}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1 - y}{y(1-y)}\right)
\]

However, a more straightforward approach is to expand the expression directly:

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{xy}
\]

Using the fact that \(y = 1 - x\), we can express \(\frac{1}{y}\) as \(\frac{1}{1-x}\). Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x}
\]

Now, we can find a common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x} = \frac{(1-x) + x}{x(1-x)} = \frac{1}{x(1-x)}
\]

Substituting this back into our expression gives:

\[
1 + \frac{1}{x(1-x)} + \frac{1}{xy}
\]

Since \(xy = x(1-x)\), we can simplify further:

\[
1 + \frac{1}{x(1-x)} + \frac{1}{x(1-x)} = 1 + 2\cdot\frac{1}{x(1-x)} = 1 + \frac{2}{x(1-x)}
\]

Now, we need to find the minimum value of \(1 + \frac{2}{x(1-x)}\) for \(x \in (0, 1)\). To do this, we can analyze the term \(\frac{2}{x(1-x)}\).

The function \(x(1-x)\) is a quadratic function that achieves its maximum at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\):

\[
x(1-x) = \frac{1}{4} \quad \text{at } x = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the minimum value of \(\frac{2}{x(1-x)}\) occurs when \(x(1-x)\) is maximized:

\[
\frac{2}{x(1-x)} \text{ is minimized at } x = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow \frac{2}{\frac{1}{4}} = 8
\]

Therefore, the minimum value of \(1 + \frac{2}{x(1-x)}\) is:

\[
1 + 8 = 9
\]

This means that the largest constant \(C\) such that 

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) \geq C
\]

for all positive \(x\) and \(y\) satisfying \(x + y = 1\) is \(C = 9\).

Thus, we conclude:

The answer is \(C=9\).
