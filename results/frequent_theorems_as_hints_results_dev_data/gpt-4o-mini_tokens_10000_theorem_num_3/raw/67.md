Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression 

\[
\frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d}
\]

given the constraint 

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4.
\]

We will use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to derive a relationship between the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the inequality we want to fill in.

### Step 1: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d} \right) \left( (5-a) + (5-b) + (5-c) + (5-d) \right) \geq (1 + 1 + 1 + 1)^2 = 16.
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Second Factor

Now, we simplify the second factor:

\[
(5-a) + (5-b) + (5-c) + (5-d) = 20 - (a + b + c + d).
\]

### Step 3: Substitute Back into the Inequality

Substituting this back into our inequality gives:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d} \right) (20 - (a + b + c + d)) \geq 16.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the Implications

From this, we can rearrange to find:

\[
\frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d} \geq \frac{16}{20 - (a + b + c + d)}.
\]

### Step 5: Find a Bound for \( a + b + c + d \)

To find a lower bound for \( a + b + c + d \), we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again:

\[
(a + b + c + d)^2 \leq 4(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) = 4 \cdot 4 = 16.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
a + b + c + d \leq 4.
\]

### Step 6: Substitute the Bound into the Inequality

If \( a + b + c + d \) can be at most 4, then:

\[
20 - (a + b + c + d) \geq 20 - 4 = 16.
\]

### Step 7: Final Inequality

Substituting this back into our earlier inequality gives:

\[
\frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d} \geq \frac{16}{16} = 1.
\]

However, we need to compare this with \( \frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \). 

### Conclusion

Since we have shown that 

\[
\frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d} \geq 1,
\]

but we need to determine if it can ever reach or exceed \( \frac{5}{4} \). 

To check if it can be greater than \( \frac{5}{4} \), we can consider the case where \( a = b = c = d = 1 \) (which satisfies \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \)). In this case:

\[
\frac{1}{5-1} + \frac{1}{5-1} + \frac{1}{5-1} + \frac{1}{5-1} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1.
\]

Thus, it does not exceed \( \frac{5}{4} \).

Therefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

\[
\frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d} \leq \frac{5}{4}.
\]

Thus, the answer is:

The answer is (A) $\leq$.
