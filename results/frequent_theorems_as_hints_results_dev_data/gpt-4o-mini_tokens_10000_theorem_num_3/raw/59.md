Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression \( |x - y + z| \) under the constraint given by the equation \( x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 = \frac{2}{5} a^2 \).

### Step 1: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to relate the expression \( |x - y + z| \) to the constraint. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers \( a_1, a_2, a_3 \) and \( b_1, b_2, b_3 \):

\[
(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + b_3^2) \geq (a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3)^2
\]

We can choose \( a_1 = x \), \( a_2 = -y \), \( a_3 = z \) and \( b_1 = 1 \), \( b_2 = 1 \), \( b_3 = 1 \). Then we have:

\[
(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) \geq (x - y + z)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)(3) \geq (x - y + z)^2
\]

### Step 2: Relate to the Given Constraint

Now, we need to express \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) in terms of the constraint. From the constraint \( x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 = \frac{2}{5} a^2 \), we can express \( y^2 \) in terms of \( x^2 \) and \( z^2 \):

Let \( y^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{5} a^2 - x^2 - z^2 \right) \).

Now, we can find \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \):

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{5} a^2 - x^2 - z^2 \right) + z^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{5} a^2 + x^2 + z^2 \right)
\]

### Step 3: Substitute Back into Cauchy-Schwarz

Now substituting back into our Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\[
3 \left( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{5} a^2 + x^2 + z^2 \right) \right) \geq (x - y + z)^2
\]

This gives:

\[
\frac{3}{2} \left( \frac{2}{5} a^2 + x^2 + z^2 \right) \geq (x - y + z)^2
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the Bound

Since \( x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 = \frac{2}{5} a^2 \), we can see that \( x^2 + z^2 \) is less than or equal to \( \frac{2}{5} a^2 \). Therefore, we can conclude that:

\[
\frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5} a^2 \geq (x - y + z)^2
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{3}{5} a^2 \geq (x - y + z)^2
\]

Taking the square root of both sides gives:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{3}{5}} a \geq |x - y + z|
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, we have established that:

\[
|x - y + z| \leq \sqrt{\frac{3}{5}} a
\]

Since \( \sqrt{\frac{3}{5}} < 1 \), we can conclude that:

\[
|x - y + z| < a
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
