Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\frac{p+q}{p-q} \geq C\frac{2(x^2-2 q x+p^2)}{x^2+2 q x+p^2}
\]

for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), we start by analyzing the right-hand side of the inequality. 

First, we rewrite the expression:

\[
\frac{2(x^2 - 2qx + p^2)}{x^2 + 2qx + p^2} = \frac{2((x - q)^2 + (p^2 - q^2))}{(x + q)^2 + (p^2 - q^2)}
\]

This shows that the expression is a rational function of \( x \). To find the maximum value of this expression, we can analyze its behavior as \( x \) varies.

### Step 1: Analyze the expression

Let 

\[
f(x) = \frac{2(x^2 - 2qx + p^2)}{x^2 + 2qx + p^2}
\]

We can find the critical points of \( f(x) \) by differentiating it and setting the derivative to zero. However, a simpler approach is to evaluate the limits and specific values of \( x \).

### Step 2: Evaluate at specific points

1. **At \( x = 0 \)**:
   \[
   f(0) = \frac{2(0 - 0 + p^2)}{0 + 0 + p^2} = 2
   \]

2. **At \( x = p \)**:
   \[
   f(p) = \frac{2(p^2 - 2qp + p^2)}{p^2 + 2qp + p^2} = \frac{2(2p^2 - 2qp)}{2p^2 + 2qp} = \frac{2(2p - 2q)}{2 + 2q/p} = \frac{2(p - q)}{1 + q/p}
   \]

3. **At \( x = q \)**:
   \[
   f(q) = \frac{2(q^2 - 2q^2 + p^2)}{q^2 + 2q^2 + p^2} = \frac{2(p^2 - q^2)}{p^2 + 3q^2}
   \]

### Step 3: Find the maximum value

To find the maximum value of \( f(x) \), we can also consider the limits as \( x \to \infty \) and \( x \to -\infty \):

- As \( x \to \infty \):
  \[
  f(x) \to 2
  \]

- As \( x \to -\infty \):
  \[
  f(x) \to 2
  \]

Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x) \) appears to be \( 2 \).

### Step 4: Set up the inequality

Now we need to satisfy the inequality:

\[
\frac{p+q}{p-q} \geq C \cdot 2
\]

This leads to:

\[
C \leq \frac{p+q}{2(p-q)}
\]

### Step 5: Determine the largest constant \( C \)

The largest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) is:

\[
C = \frac{p+q}{2(p-q)}
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C = \frac{p+q}{2(p-q)}.
\]
