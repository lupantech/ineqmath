Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression \( a^5 + 16b^5 \) under the constraint \( a + b = 1 \) where \( a, b \geq 0 \).

First, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):
\[
b = 1 - a.
\]
Substituting this into the expression gives:
\[
a^5 + 16b^5 = a^5 + 16(1 - a)^5.
\]

Next, we will analyze the function \( f(a) = a^5 + 16(1 - a)^5 \) for \( a \in [0, 1] \). To find the maximum value of this function, we can take the derivative and set it to zero.

Calculating the derivative:
\[
f'(a) = 5a^4 - 80(1 - a)^4.
\]
Setting \( f'(a) = 0 \):
\[
5a^4 = 80(1 - a)^4.
\]
Dividing both sides by 5:
\[
a^4 = 16(1 - a)^4.
\]
Taking the fourth root:
\[
a = 2(1 - a).
\]
Solving for \( a \):
\[
a = 2 - 2a \implies 3a = 2 \implies a = \frac{2}{3}.
\]
Thus, we find \( b \):
\[
b = 1 - a = 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Now we evaluate \( f(a) \) at \( a = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( b = \frac{1}{3} \):
\[
f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5 + 16\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^5.
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5 = \frac{32}{243},
\]
\[
16\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^5 = 16 \cdot \frac{1}{243} = \frac{16}{243}.
\]
Adding these together:
\[
f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{243} + \frac{16}{243} = \frac{48}{243} = \frac{16}{81}.
\]

Next, we need to compare \( \frac{16}{81} \) with \( \frac{1}{6} \):
To do this, we convert \( \frac{1}{6} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 81:
\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{13.5}{81}.
\]
Now we compare:
\[
\frac{16}{81} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{13.5}{81}.
\]
Since \( 16 > 13.5 \), we have:
\[
\frac{16}{81} > \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, we conclude that:
\[
a^5 + 16b^5 > \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:
\[
\text{The answer is (E) } >.
\]
