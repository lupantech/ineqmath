Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \quad () \quad 2,
\]

given that \(abc = 1\) and \(a, b, c\) are positive real numbers, we can use the method of substitution and the AM-GM inequality.

### Step 1: Apply the AM-GM Inequality

We can apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms \(\frac{1}{a}\), \(\frac{2}{b}\), and \(\frac{1}{c}\). According to the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} + \frac{1}{c}}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{2}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{c}}.
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Right Side

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{2}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{c} = \frac{2}{abc} = \frac{2}{1} = 2.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} + \frac{1}{c}}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Multiply by 3

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq 3\sqrt[3]{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate \(3\sqrt[3]{2}\)

Now we need to evaluate \(3\sqrt[3]{2}\):

Calculating \(\sqrt[3]{2} \approx 1.2599\), we find:

\[
3\sqrt[3]{2} \approx 3 \times 1.2599 \approx 3.7797.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with 2

Since \(3\sqrt[3]{2} > 2\), we conclude that:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq 3\sqrt[3]{2} > 2.
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, we have shown that:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} + \frac{1}{c} > 2.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \quad > \quad 2.
\]

The answer is (E) >.
