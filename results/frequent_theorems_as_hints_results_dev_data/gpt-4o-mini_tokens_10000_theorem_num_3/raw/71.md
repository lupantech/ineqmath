Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} \quad () \quad 2 \sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c},
\]

we will analyze both sides of the inequality.

### Step 1: Analyze the Left Side

The left side is 

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}}.
\]

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we can estimate this sum. By applying Cauchy-Schwarz, we have:

\[
\left( \sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{cyc} (b+c)^2 \right) \left( \sum_{cyc} \frac{1}{(a+b)(a+c)} \right).
\]

Calculating the first sum:

\[
\sum_{cyc} (b+c)^2 = (b+c)^2 + (c+a)^2 + (a+b)^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + ab + ac + bc).
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Right Side

The right side is 

\[
2 \sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c} = 2 \left( \frac{2a}{2b+c} + \frac{2b}{2c+a} + \frac{2c}{2a+b} \right).
\]

### Step 3: Compare Both Sides

To compare both sides, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again on the right side:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c} \geq \frac{(2a + 2b + 2c)^2}{\sum_{cyc} (2b+c)} = \frac{(2(a+b+c))^2}{\sum_{cyc} (2b+c)}.
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
\sum_{cyc} (2b+c) = 2(a+b+c) + (a+b+c) = 3(a+b+c).
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c} \geq \frac{4(a+b+c)^2}{3(a+b+c)} = \frac{4(a+b+c)}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: Final Comparison

Now we need to compare:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8(a+b+c)}{3}.
\]

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again on the left side, we can show that:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} \leq \frac{(b+c+c+a+a+b)^2}{\sum_{cyc} (a+b)(a+c)}.
\]

This leads us to conclude that the left side is less than or equal to the right side.

### Conclusion

After analyzing both sides and applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we find that:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{b+c}{\sqrt{(a+b)(a+c)}} \leq 2 \sum_{cyc} \frac{2a}{2b+c}.
\]

Thus, the correct relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (A) $\leq$.
