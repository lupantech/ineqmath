    "response": "To solve the problem, we start with the constraint given by the equation:\n\n\\[\n(x+1)(y+2) = 8.\n\\]\n\nWe can express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\ny + 2 = \\frac{8}{x + 1} \\implies y = \\frac{8}{x + 1} - 2 = \\frac{8 - 2(x + 1)}{x + 1} = \\frac{6 - 2x}{x + 1}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we want to analyze the expression \\(xy\\):\n\n\\[\nxy = x\\left(\\frac{6 - 2x}{x + 1}\\right) = \\frac{6x - 2x^2}{x + 1}.\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the largest constant \\(C\\) such that:\n\n\\[\n|xy - 10| \\geq C.\n\\]\n\nThis means we need to find the minimum value of \\(xy\\) and the maximum value of \\(xy\\) under the constraint. We will analyze the function \\(f(x) = xy\\) to find its extrema.\n\nTo find the critical points, we differentiate \\(f(x)\\):\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{6x - 2x^2}{x + 1}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the quotient rule, we have:\n\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{(6 - 4x)(x + 1) - (6x - 2x^2)(1)}{(x + 1)^2}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\n\\[\n(6 - 4x)(x + 1) - (6x - 2x^2) = 6x + 6 - 4x^2 - 4x - 6x + 2x^2 = -2x^2 + 6.\n\\]\n\nSetting the numerator equal to zero to find critical points:\n\n\\[\n-2x^2 + 6 = 0 \\implies 2x^2 = 6 \\implies x^2 = 3 \\implies x = \\sqrt{3} \\text{ or } x = -\\sqrt{3}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we evaluate \\(f(x)\\) at these critical points and also check the endpoints of the feasible region defined by the constraint.\n\n1. **At \\(x = \\sqrt{3}\\)**:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{6 - 2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} + 1} = \\frac{6 - 2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} + 1}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(xy\\):\n\n\\[\nxy = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\frac{6 - 2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} + 1}.\n\\]\n\n2. **At \\(x = -\\sqrt{3}\\)**:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{6 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{-\\sqrt{3} + 1} = \\frac{6 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{1 - \\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(xy\\):\n\n\\[\nxy = -\\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\frac{6 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{1 - \\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\n3. **Endpoints**: As \\(x \\to -1\\) (from the right), \\(y \\to 6\\) and \\(xy \\to -6\\).
