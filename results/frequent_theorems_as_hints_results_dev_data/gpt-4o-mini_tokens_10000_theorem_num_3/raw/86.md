Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To analyze the expression 

\[
S = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{2x^2 + 1} + \frac{y^2 - z^2}{2y^2 + 1} + \frac{z^2 - x^2}{2z^2 + 1},
\]

we will investigate the behavior of each term in the sum. 

### Step 1: Simplifying Each Term

Each term in the expression can be rewritten as follows:

1. The first term: 
   \[
   \frac{x^2 - y^2}{2x^2 + 1} = \frac{(x-y)(x+y)}{2x^2 + 1}.
   \]

2. The second term:
   \[
   \frac{y^2 - z^2}{2y^2 + 1} = \frac{(y-z)(y+z)}{2y^2 + 1}.
   \]

3. The third term:
   \[
   \frac{z^2 - x^2}{2z^2 + 1} = \frac{(z-x)(z+x)}{2z^2 + 1}.
   \]

### Step 2: Analyzing the Signs

The signs of the terms depend on the relative sizes of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). 

- If \(x \geq y\), then \(x^2 - y^2 \geq 0\) and thus the first term is non-negative.
- If \(y \geq z\), then \(y^2 - z^2 \geq 0\) and thus the second term is non-negative.
- If \(z \geq x\), then \(z^2 - x^2 \geq 0\) and thus the third term is non-negative.

### Step 3: Considering the Case of Equality

If \(x = y = z\), then each term becomes:

\[
\frac{x^2 - x^2}{2x^2 + 1} = 0.
\]

Thus, \(S = 0\) in this case.

### Step 4: General Case

Now, consider the case where \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are not all equal. 

- If \(x > y > z\), then \(x^2 - y^2 > 0\), \(y^2 - z^2 > 0\), and \(z^2 - x^2 < 0\). The positive contributions from the first two terms may not be enough to offset the negative contribution from the third term.
- Conversely, if \(x < y < z\), then \(x^2 - y^2 < 0\), \(y^2 - z^2 < 0\), and \(z^2 - x^2 > 0\). Again, the positive contribution from the third term may not be enough to offset the negative contributions from the first two terms.

### Step 5: Conclusion

In general, the expression \(S\) can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). However, we can conclude that:

- The expression can equal zero when \(x = y = z\).
- The expression can be negative when the differences \(x^2 - y^2\), \(y^2 - z^2\), and \(z^2 - x^2\) do not balance out.

Thus, we can conclude that:

\[
S \leq 0.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (A) $\leq$.
