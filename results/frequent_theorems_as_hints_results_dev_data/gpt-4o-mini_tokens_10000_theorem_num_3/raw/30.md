Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression 

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right)^2 + \left(b + \frac{1}{b}\right)^2
\]

given the constraint \( a + b = 1 \) with \( a, b > 0 \). We will find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a \) and \( b \).

First, we can rewrite the expression in terms of \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right)^2 + \left(b + \frac{1}{b}\right)^2 = \left(a^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{a^2}\right) + \left(b^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{b^2}\right) = a^2 + b^2 + \frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{b^2} + 4
\]

Using the identity \( a + b = 1 \), we can express \( b \) as \( b = 1 - a \). Thus, we can express \( b^2 \) as:

\[
b^2 = (1 - a)^2 = 1 - 2a + a^2
\]

Now, substituting \( b^2 \) into the expression gives:

\[
a^2 + b^2 = a^2 + (1 - 2a + a^2) = 2a^2 - 2a + 1
\]

Next, we need to compute \( \frac{1}{b^2} \):

\[
\frac{1}{b^2} = \frac{1}{(1 - a)^2}
\]

Thus, we need to analyze the term \( \frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{(1 - a)^2} \). We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to find a lower bound for this term:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{(1-a)^2} \right) \geq \frac{(1 + 1)^2}{a^2 + (1-a)^2} = \frac{4}{a^2 + (1 - 2a + a^2)} = \frac{4}{1 - 2a + 2a^2}
\]

Now, we can simplify \( a^2 + (1-a)^2 \):

\[
a^2 + (1-a)^2 = 2a^2 - 2a + 1
\]

Next, we need to find the minimum value of \( 2a^2 - 2a + 1 \) for \( a \in (0, 1) \). This is a quadratic function in \( a \) and can be minimized by completing the square or using calculus. The vertex of the quadratic \( 2a^2 - 2a + 1 \) occurs at:

\[
a = -\frac{b}{2a} = \frac{2}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 1 + 1 = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the minimum value of \( 2a^2 - 2a + 1 \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Now, substituting back into our inequality:

\[
\frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{(1-a)^2} \geq 4
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right)^2 + \left(b + \frac{1}{b}\right)^2 \geq 4 + 4 = 8
\]

Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a, b > 0 \) with \( a + b = 1 \) is:

\[
C = 8
\]

Finally, we conclude:

The answer is \( C=8 \).
