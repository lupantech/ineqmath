Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the following inequality holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \):

\[
\frac{a}{\sqrt{3a + 2b + c}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{3b + 2c + a}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{3c + 2a + b}} \leq C \sqrt{a + b + c}.
\]

### Step 1: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the left-hand side of the inequality. According to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^2 \right) \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i \right)^2.
\]

Let \( x_1 = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3a + 2b + c}}, x_2 = \frac{b}{\sqrt{3b + 2c + a}}, x_3 = \frac{c}{\sqrt{3c + 2a + b}} \) and \( y_1 = \sqrt{3a + 2b + c}, y_2 = \sqrt{3b + 2c + a}, y_3 = \sqrt{3c + 2a + b} \).

Applying Cauchy-Schwarz gives us:

\[
\left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{3a + 2b + c}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{3b + 2c + a}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{3c + 2a + b}} \right)^2 \leq (a + b + c) \left( \frac{3a + 2b + c + 3b + 2c + a + 3c + 2a + b}{3} \right).
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Right-Hand Side

Now, we simplify the right-hand side:

\[
3a + 2b + c + 3b + 2c + a + 3c + 2a + b = 6a + 6b + 6c = 6(a + b + c).
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{3a + 2b + c}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{3b + 2c + a}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{3c + 2a + b}} \right)^2 \leq (a + b + c) \cdot 2(a + b + c) = 2(a + b + c)^2.
\]

Taking the square root of both sides gives:

\[
\frac{a}{\sqrt{3a + 2b + c}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{3b + 2c + a}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{3c + 2a + b}} \leq \sqrt{2} \sqrt{a + b + c}.
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Constant \( C \)

From the above inequality, we can see that the left-hand side is bounded by \( \sqrt{2} \sqrt{a + b + c} \). Therefore, we can conclude that:

\[
C \geq \sqrt{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Check if \( C = \sqrt{2} \) is Achievable

To check if \( C = \sqrt{2} \) is indeed the smallest constant, we can test the case when \( a = b = c \). Let \( a = b = c = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1 + 1}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1 + 1}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1 + 1}} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}.
\]

On the right-hand side:

\[
\sqrt{2} \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} \leq \sqrt{6},
\]

which holds true. Therefore, \( C = \sqrt{2} \) is achievable.

### Conclusion

The smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \) is:

\[
\boxed{C = \sqrt{2}}.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is \( C = \sqrt{2} \).
