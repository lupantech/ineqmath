Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression \( a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 \) under the given conditions: \( a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n = 0 \) and \( \max \{|a_i - a_j| \mid 1 \leq i, j \leq n\} \leq 1 \).

### Step 1: Understanding the constraints

1. **Sum Condition**: The condition \( a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n = 0 \) implies that the numbers \( a_i \) are balanced around zero.
2. **Max Difference Condition**: The condition \( \max \{|a_i - a_j| \mid 1 \leq i, j \leq n\} \leq 1 \) means that all \( a_i \) are within a distance of 1 from each other. This implies that if we denote the maximum and minimum of the \( a_i \) values as \( M \) and \( m \), respectively, then \( M - m \leq 1 \).

### Step 2: Expressing \( a_i \)

Given the constraints, we can express the \( a_i \) values in terms of a central value \( c \) (which could be the average or some other central point) and a deviation \( d \):
- Let \( a_i = c + x_i \) where \( x_i \) are deviations from \( c \).
- The condition \( a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n = 0 \) translates to \( nc + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 0 \), hence \( c = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \).

### Step 3: Analyzing \( a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 \)

We can express the sum of squares as:
\[
a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (c + x_i)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (c^2 + 2cx_i + x_i^2) = nc^2 + 2c\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2
\]
Since \( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 0 \), the expression simplifies to:
\[
a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 = nc^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2
\]

### Step 4: Finding bounds for \( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \)

Using the condition \( \max |a_i - a_j| \leq 1 \), we have:
\[
|x_i - x_j| \leq 1 \quad \text{for all } i, j
\]
This implies that all \( x_i \) are within 0.5 of the average of the \( x_i \) values. 

### Step 5: Applying Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
\[
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n 1 \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \right) \geq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right)^2
\]
This gives:
\[
n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \geq 0 \implies \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \geq 0
\]

### Step 6: Finding the upper bound

Since \( |x_i| \leq \frac{1}{2} \) (because the maximum difference is 1), we can bound \( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \):
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \leq n \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{n}{4}
\]

### Step 7: Putting it all together

Now we can express \( a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 \):
\[
a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 = nc^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2
\]
Given \( c = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \) and the bounds we derived, we can conclude that:
\[
a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 \leq \frac{n}{4} + \frac{n}{4} = \frac{n}{2}
\]

### Step 8: Comparing with the right-hand side

The right-hand side of the inequality is:
\[
\frac{1}{n}\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right] = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{4} = \frac{n+1}{4}
\]

### Conclusion

Since \( \frac{n}{2} \) is greater than \( \frac{n+1}{4} \) for \( n \geq 1 \), we conclude:
\[
a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 \geq \frac{1}{n}\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right]
\]

Thus, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:
\[
\text{The answer is (B) } \geq
\]
