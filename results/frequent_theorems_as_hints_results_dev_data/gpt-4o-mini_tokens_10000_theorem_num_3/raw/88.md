Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
a^2 + 4b^2 + 4b + 8c \quad () \quad 7 + 2\sqrt{2(b^2 + c^2)} + 4\sqrt{bc},
\]

given that \( a + b + c = 3 \) and \( a, b, c > 0 \), we will analyze both sides of the inequality.

### Step 1: Analyze the left-hand side

The left-hand side is 

\[
L = a^2 + 4b^2 + 4b + 8c.
\]

Using the constraint \( a + b + c = 3 \), we can express \( c \) in terms of \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
c = 3 - a - b.
\]

Substituting this into \( L \):

\[
L = a^2 + 4b^2 + 4b + 8(3 - a - b) = a^2 + 4b^2 + 4b + 24 - 8a - 8b.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
L = a^2 + 4b^2 - 8b - 8a + 24.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the right-hand side

The right-hand side is 

\[
R = 7 + 2\sqrt{2(b^2 + c^2)} + 4\sqrt{bc}.
\]

Substituting \( c = 3 - a - b \) into \( R \):

\[
c^2 = (3 - a - b)^2 = 9 - 6a - 6b + a^2 + 2ab + b^2,
\]

thus,

\[
b^2 + c^2 = b^2 + (9 - 6a - 6b + a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = 9 - 6a - 5b + a^2 + 2ab.
\]

Now, we need to compute \( \sqrt{2(b^2 + c^2)} \):

\[
\sqrt{2(b^2 + c^2)} = \sqrt{2(9 - 6a - 5b + a^2 + 2ab)}.
\]

### Step 3: Use inequalities

To compare \( L \) and \( R \), we can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 

Using Cauchy-Schwarz on \( (1, 2, 2) \) and \( (a^2, b^2, c^2) \):

\[
(1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2)(a^2 + 4b^2 + 4c^2) \geq (a + 2b + 2c)^2.
\]

Calculating the left side:

\[
1 + 4 + 4 = 9,
\]

and the right side:

\[
(a + 2b + 2c)^2 = (a + 2b + 2(3 - a - b))^2 = (6 + b - a)^2.
\]

This gives us:

\[
9(a^2 + 4b^2 + 4c^2) \geq (6 + b - a)^2.
\]

### Step 4: Test specific values

To find the relationship, we can test specific values of \( a, b, c \). 

Letâ€™s try \( a = 1, b = 1, c = 1 \):

\[
L = 1^2 + 4(1^2) + 4(1) + 8(1) = 1 + 4 + 4 + 8 = 17,
\]

\[
R = 7 + 2\sqrt{2(1^2 + 1^2)} + 4\sqrt{1 \cdot 1} = 7 + 2\sqrt{4} + 4 = 7 + 4 + 4 = 15.
\]

Here, \( L = 17 \) and \( R = 15 \), so \( L > R \).

### Conclusion

Since we found a case where \( L > R \), we can conclude that the inequality 

\[
a^2 + 4b^2 + 4b + 8c \geq 7 + 2\sqrt{2(b^2 + c^2)} + 4\sqrt{bc}
\]

holds for positive \( a, b, c \) such that \( a + b + c = 3 \).

Thus, the correct relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
