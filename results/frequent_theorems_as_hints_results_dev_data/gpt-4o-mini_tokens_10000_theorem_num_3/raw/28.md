Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To find the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \leq C
\]

holds for all \( a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R} \) satisfying the constraint 

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4,
\]

we can utilize the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

### Step 1: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)(a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4) \geq (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3)^2.
\]

### Step 2: Substitute the Constraint

From the problem, we know that \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \). Thus, we can substitute this into our inequality:

\[
4(a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4) \geq (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3)^2.
\]

### Step 3: Find an Upper Bound for \( a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 \)

To find \( a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 \), we can use the Power Mean inequality. The Power Mean inequality states that:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4}{4}} \leq \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2}{4}}.
\]

Substituting \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4}{4}} \leq \sqrt{1} = 1.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 \leq 4.
\]

### Step 4: Substitute Back into the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Now substituting this back into our earlier inequality:

\[
4 \cdot 4 \geq (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3)^2,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
16 \geq (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3)^2.
\]

Taking the square root of both sides gives:

\[
4 \geq a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3.
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion

This shows that the maximum value of \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \) is \( 4 \). Therefore, the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a, b, c, d \) satisfying the constraint is:

\[
C = 4.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=4.
\]
