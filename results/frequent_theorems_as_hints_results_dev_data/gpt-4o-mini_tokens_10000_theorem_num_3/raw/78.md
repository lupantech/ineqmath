Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 2abc + \frac{4a^2b^2c^2}{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + abc} \quad () \quad \sum_{\text{cyc}}(2a^2b + 3a^2c),
\]

we will analyze both sides of the inequality.

### Step 1: Analyze the Left Side

The left side consists of two parts:

1. \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 2abc \)
2. \( \frac{4a^2b^2c^2}{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + abc} \)

Using the identity for the sum of cubes, we know:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc).
\]

Thus, we can express \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 2abc \) as:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 2abc = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) + 3abc.
\]

This shows that \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 2abc \) is non-negative since \( a, b, c \) are non-negative.

The second term \( \frac{4a^2b^2c^2}{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + abc} \) is also non-negative as long as \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + abc \neq 0 \) (which is given).

### Step 2: Analyze the Right Side

The right side is:

\[
\sum_{\text{cyc}}(2a^2b + 3a^2c) = 2a^2b + 2b^2c + 2c^2a + 3a^2c + 3b^2a + 3c^2b.
\]

This expression is also non-negative since it is a sum of non-negative terms.

### Step 3: Compare Both Sides

To compare both sides, we can use specific values for \( a, b, c \) to test the inequality. 

Letâ€™s take \( a = 1, b = 1, c = 1 \):

- Left Side:
\[
1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3 + 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 + \frac{4 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1^2}{1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = 3 + 2 + \frac{4}{4} = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
\]

- Right Side:
\[
2 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1 = 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 15.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
6 \quad () \quad 15.
\]

This suggests that the left side is less than the right side.

### Step 4: General Case

To generalize, we can apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms on the right side. Each term \( 2a^2b + 3a^2c \) can be shown to be less than or equal to a combination of the cubes and products on the left side, especially since the left side includes \( 2abc \) which balances the terms.

### Conclusion

After testing specific values and analyzing the structure of both sides, we conclude that:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 2abc + \frac{4a^2b^2c^2}{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + abc} \leq \sum_{\text{cyc}}(2a^2b + 3a^2c).
\]

Thus, the correct relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (A) $\leq$.
