$$

Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
a + b + c + \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} \leq C
\]

holds for all non-negative \( a, b, c \) satisfying the constraint 

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 4.
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the constraint

The constraint \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 4 \) suggests that \( a, b, c \) are bounded. We will explore specific cases to find the maximum value of the left-hand side of the inequality.

### Step 2: Test specific cases

1. **Case 1: \( a = b = c = 0 \)**

   \[
   0 + 0 + 0 + \sqrt{\frac{0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2}{3}} = 0.
   \]

2. **Case 2: \( a = b = c = 2 \)**

   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 4 + 4 + 4 + 8 = 20 \quad \text{(not valid)}
   \]

3. **Case 3: \( a = b = c = 1 \)**

   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.
   \]

   Now calculate the left-hand side:

   \[
   1 + 1 + 1 + \sqrt{\frac{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}{3}} = 3 + \sqrt{1} = 3 + 1 = 4.
   \]

4. **Case 4: \( a = 2, b = 0, c = 0 \)**

   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 2 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 = 4 + 0 = 4.
   \]

   Now calculate the left-hand side:

   \[
   2 + 0 + 0 + \sqrt{\frac{2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2}{3}} = 2 + \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}} = 2 + \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}.
   \]

   To simplify \( 2 + \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \):

   \[
   2 + \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} = 2 + \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 2 + 1.1547 \approx 3.1547.
   \]

5. **Case 5: \( a = 1, b = 1, c = 1 \)** (already calculated)

   The maximum value we found was \( 4 \).

### Step 3: Find the maximum value

From the cases we tested, the maximum value of \( a + b + c + \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} \) occurs when \( a = b = c = 1 \), yielding \( 4 \).

### Conclusion

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all non-negative \( a, b, c \) satisfying the constraint is 

\[
C = 4.
\]

Therefore, the answer is 

\[
\text{The answer is } C=4.
\]
