Problem: Let $x > 4$. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x$:

$$
\frac{x^3}{x-4} \geq C.
$$

Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{x^3}{x-4} \geq C
\]

holds for all \( x > 4 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the function

We can rewrite the inequality as:

\[
\frac{x^3}{x-4} - C \geq 0.
\]

Let \( f(x) = \frac{x^3}{x-4} \). We want to find the minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x > 4 \).

### Step 2: Find the derivative

To find the minimum value of \( f(x) \), we first compute its derivative:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{(x-4)(3x^2) - x^3(1)}{(x-4)^2} = \frac{3x^2(x-4) - x^3}{(x-4)^2} = \frac{3x^3 - 12x^2 - x^3}{(x-4)^2} = \frac{2x^3 - 12x^2}{(x-4)^2} = \frac{2x^2(x-6)}{(x-4)^2}.
\]

### Step 3: Set the derivative to zero

Setting \( f'(x) = 0 \):

\[
2x^2(x-6) = 0.
\]

This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( x = 6 \). Since we are only interested in \( x > 4 \), we consider \( x = 6 \).

### Step 4: Evaluate \( f(x) \) at critical points and endpoints

Next, we evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = 6 \):

\[
f(6) = \frac{6^3}{6-4} = \frac{216}{2} = 108.
\]

Now, we also need to check the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches \( 4 \) from the right:

\[
\lim_{x \to 4^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 4^+} \frac{x^3}{x-4} = \infty.
\]

As \( x \to \infty \):

\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^3}{x-4} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^3}{x} = x^2 \to \infty.
\]

### Step 5: Determine the minimum value

Since \( f(x) \) approaches infinity as \( x \) approaches \( 4 \) and also as \( x \) approaches infinity, and we found that \( f(6) = 108 \) is the only critical point in the interval \( (4, \infty) \), we conclude that the minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x > 4 \) is \( 108 \).

### Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\frac{x^3}{x-4} \geq C
\]

for all \( x > 4 \) is 

\[
C = 108.
\]

Therefore, the answer is 

\[
\text{The answer is } C=108.
\]
