Problem: Let $x, y, z \in [0,1]$. Determine the minimal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x, y, z$:
$$

$$

Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
x(x-y)(z-x) \leq C
\]

holds for all \( x, y, z \in [0, 1] \).

### Step 1: Analyze the expression

The expression \( x(x-y)(z-x) \) can be rewritten as:

\[
x(zx - x^2 - xy + yx) = x(zx - x^2 - xy + yx)
\]

This expression is a product of three terms: \( x \), \( (x-y) \), and \( (z-x) \). 

### Step 2: Determine the bounds of each term

1. **For \( x \)**: Since \( x \in [0, 1] \), we have \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
2. **For \( (x-y) \)**: Since \( y \in [0, 1] \), the term \( (x-y) \) can take values in the range \( [-1, 1] \). However, since \( x \) and \( y \) are both in \( [0, 1] \), we can restrict \( (x-y) \) to \( [0, 1] \) when \( x \geq y \) and \( [-1, 0] \) when \( x < y \).
3. **For \( (z-x) \)**: Similarly, since \( z \in [0, 1] \), the term \( (z-x) \) can also take values in the range \( [0, 1] \) when \( z \geq x \) and \( [-1, 0] \) when \( z < x \).

### Step 3: Find critical points

To find the maximum value of \( x(x-y)(z-x) \), we can evaluate it at the boundaries of the intervals and at critical points. 

1. **When \( x = 0 \)**: 
   \[
   0(0-y)(z-0) = 0
   \]

2. **When \( x = 1 \)**: 
   \[
   1(1-y)(z-1) = (1-y)(z-1)
   \]
   This can be \( 0 \) if \( z = 1 \) or \( y = 1 \).

3. **When \( y = 0 \)**: 
   \[
   x(x-0)(z-x) = x^2(z-x)
   \]
   This is maximized when \( z = 1 \) and \( x = 1 \), yielding \( 1^2(1-1) = 0 \).

4. **When \( z = 0 \)**: 
   \[
   x(x-y)(0-x) = -x^2(x-y)
   \]
   This is non-positive.

### Step 4: Evaluate at specific points

To find the maximum value, we can evaluate the expression at specific points in the interval \( [0, 1] \):

- Let \( x = 0.5 \), \( y = 0 \), \( z = 1 \):
  \[
  0.5(0.5-0)(1-0.5) = 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.125
  \]

- Let \( x = 0.5 \), \( y = 0.5 \), \( z = 1 \):
  \[
  0.5(0.5-0.5)(1-0.5) = 0
  \]

- Let \( x = 1 \), \( y = 0 \), \( z = 1 \):
  \[
  1(1-0)(1-1) = 0
  \]

### Step 5: Conclusion

After evaluating various combinations of \( x, y, z \) in the interval \( [0, 1] \), we find that the maximum value of \( x(x-y)(z-x) \) is \( 0.125 \). Therefore, the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( x, y, z \in [0, 1] \) is:

\[
C = 0.125
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C = 0.125
\]
