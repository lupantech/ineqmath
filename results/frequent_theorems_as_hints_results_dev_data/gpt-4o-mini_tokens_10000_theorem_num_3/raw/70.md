Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a} \quad () \quad -3a + b + 7c,
\]

we will analyze the left-hand side and the right-hand side separately and then compare them.

### Step 1: Analyze the left-hand side

We have the expression:

\[
L = \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a}.
\]

### Step 2: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the terms in \(L\). According to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\[
\left( \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a} \right) \left( b + c + \frac{4a}{1} \right) \geq \left( a + b + 2c \right)^2.
\]

Let’s denote \(x = a\), \(y = b\), and \(z = c\). Then we can rewrite the inequality as:

\[
\left( \frac{x^2}{y} + \frac{y^2}{z} + \frac{4z^2}{x} \right) \left( y + z + 4x \right) \geq (x + y + 2z)^2.
\]

### Step 3: Choose specific values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\)

To analyze the inequality further, we can choose specific values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Let’s set \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
L = \frac{1^2}{1} + \frac{1^2}{1} + \frac{4 \cdot 1^2}{1} = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.
\]

Now, we compute the right-hand side:

\[
R = -3(1) + 1 + 7(1) = -3 + 1 + 7 = 5.
\]

### Step 4: Compare \(L\) and \(R\)

From our calculations, we have:

\[
L = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad R = 5.
\]

Thus, we find that:

\[
L > R.
\]

### Step 5: Generalize the result

Since we have shown that for \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 1\), the left-hand side is greater than the right-hand side, we can conclude that the inequality holds in general for positive \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

### Conclusion

Therefore, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

\[
\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{4c^2}{a} \geq -3a + b + 7c.
\]

Thus, the answer is:

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
