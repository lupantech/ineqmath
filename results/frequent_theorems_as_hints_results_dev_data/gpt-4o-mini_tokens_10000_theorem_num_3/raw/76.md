Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\sum \frac{a(a^3+1)}{3b+c} \quad () \quad 2a^3 + b^3 + c^3,
\]

where \( abc = 1 \) and \( a, b, c \) are positive real numbers, we will analyze both sides of the inequality.

### Step 1: Analyze the Left Side

We start with the left-hand side:

\[
\sum \frac{a(a^3+1)}{3b+c} = \frac{a(a^3+1)}{3b+c} + \frac{b(b^3+1)}{3c+a} + \frac{c(c^3+1)}{3a+b}.
\]

### Step 2: Simplify Each Term

Each term can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{a^4}{3b+c} + \frac{a}{3b+c}.
\]

Thus, we can express the left-hand side as:

\[
\sum \left( \frac{a^4}{3b+c} + \frac{a}{3b+c} \right).
\]

### Step 3: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the first part:

\[
\sum \frac{a^4}{3b+c} \cdot \sum (3b+c) \geq \left( \sum a^2 \right)^2.
\]

Calculating \( \sum (3b+c) = 3(a+b+c) \), we have:

\[
\sum \frac{a^4}{3b+c} \cdot 3(a+b+c) \geq \left( \sum a^2 \right)^2.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the Right Side

Now, consider the right-hand side:

\[
2a^3 + b^3 + c^3.
\]

Using the Power Mean inequality, we know that:

\[
\frac{2a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{3} \geq (abc)^{\frac{1}{3}} = 1,
\]

which implies:

\[
2a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \geq 3.
\]

### Step 5: Compare Both Sides

Now we need to compare the two sides. We have established that:

1. The left-hand side can be bounded using Cauchy-Schwarz.
2. The right-hand side is at least 3.

To show that the left-hand side is less than or equal to the right-hand side, we can use the AM-GM inequality:

\[
\frac{a^4 + b^4 + c^4}{3} \geq (abc)^{\frac{4}{3}} = 1,
\]

which implies:

\[
a^4 + b^4 + c^4 \geq 3.
\]

### Conclusion

After analyzing both sides and applying inequalities, we find that:

\[
\sum \frac{a(a^3+1)}{3b+c} \leq 2a^3 + b^3 + c^3.
\]

Thus, the correct relation to fill in the blank is:

\[
\sum \frac{a(a^3+1)}{3b+c} \leq 2a^3 + b^3 + c^3.
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is (A) $\leq$.
