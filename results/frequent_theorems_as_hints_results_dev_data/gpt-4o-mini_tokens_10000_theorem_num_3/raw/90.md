Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(ab + bc + ca).
\]

This can be rearranged to:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 0.
\]

This implies that:

\[
(a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2 = 0.
\]

Since squares of real numbers are non-negative, the only solution is:

\[
a = b = c.
\]

Let \( a = b = c = k \) for some non-zero real number \( k \). We can now substitute \( a, b, c \) into the expression we need to analyze:

\[
(a+b+c)\left(\frac{1}{2a}+\frac{1}{3b}+\frac{1}{c}\right).
\]

Substituting \( a = b = c = k \):

\[
a + b + c = k + k + k = 3k,
\]

and

\[
\frac{1}{2a} + \frac{1}{3b} + \frac{1}{c} = \frac{1}{2k} + \frac{1}{3k} + \frac{1}{k}.
\]

Finding a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{2k} + \frac{1}{3k} + \frac{1}{k} = \frac{3}{6k} + \frac{2}{6k} + \frac{6}{6k} = \frac{3 + 2 + 6}{6k} = \frac{11}{6k}.
\]

Now, we can combine these results:

\[
(3k)\left(\frac{11}{6k}\right) = \frac{33k}{6k} = \frac{33}{6} = 5.5.
\]

Next, we need to compare this result with 14:

\[
5.5 \quad \text{and} \quad 14.
\]

Clearly, \( 5.5 < 14 \).

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
(a+b+c)\left(\frac{1}{2a}+\frac{1}{3b}+\frac{1}{c}\right) < 14.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
