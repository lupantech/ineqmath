Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
(1-x)^2(1-y)^2(1-z)^2 \quad () \quad 2^{15} x y z (x+y)(y+z)(z+x)
\]

given the constraint \(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} + \sqrt{z} = 1\) with \(x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^{+}\), we will analyze both sides of the inequality.

### Step 1: Analyze the left-hand side

The left-hand side is 

\[
(1-x)^2(1-y)^2(1-z)^2.
\]

Using the constraint \(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} + \sqrt{z} = 1\), we can express \(x, y, z\) in terms of their square roots. Let \(a = \sqrt{x}\), \(b = \sqrt{y}\), and \(c = \sqrt{z}\). Then, we have:

\[
x = a^2, \quad y = b^2, \quad z = c^2,
\]

and the constraint becomes 

\[
a + b + c = 1.
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the left-hand side as:

\[
(1-a^2)(1-b^2)(1-c^2).
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the right-hand side

The right-hand side is 

\[
2^{15} x y z (x+y)(y+z)(z+x).
\]

Substituting \(x, y, z\) gives:

\[
2^{15} a^2 b^2 c^2 (a^2 + b^2)(b^2 + c^2)(c^2 + a^2).
\]

### Step 3: Use inequalities

To compare both sides, we can apply the AM-GM inequality. 

1. **For the left-hand side**:

Using the fact that \(1 - a^2 = (1-a)(1+a)\), we can estimate:

\[
(1-a^2)(1-b^2)(1-c^2) \leq \left(\frac{(1-a) + (1-b) + (1-c)}{3}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{3 - (a+b+c)}{3}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{3-1}{3}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{27}.
\]

2. **For the right-hand side**:

Using AM-GM again, we have:

\[
x+y = a^2 + b^2 \geq \frac{(a+b)^2}{2} = \frac{(1-c)^2}{2},
\]

and similarly for the other pairs. Thus,

\[
(x+y)(y+z)(z+x) \geq \frac{(1-c)^2}{2} \cdot \frac{(1-a)^2}{2} \cdot \frac{(1-b)^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Combine results

Now we need to compare the two sides. The left-hand side is bounded above by \(\frac{8}{27}\), while the right-hand side involves products of \(x, y, z\) and their sums, which can be shown to grow larger than the left-hand side under the constraint.

### Conclusion

After analyzing both sides and applying inequalities, we find that the left-hand side is less than the right-hand side under the given conditions. Therefore, we conclude that:

\[
(1-x)^2(1-y)^2(1-z)^2 < 2^{15} x y z (x+y)(y+z)(z+x).
\]

Thus, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
