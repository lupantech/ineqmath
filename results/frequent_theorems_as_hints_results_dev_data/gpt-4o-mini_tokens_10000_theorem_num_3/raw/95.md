Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given equation:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + 3 = 4ab.
\]

We can rearrange this equation to:

\[
a^2 - 4ab + b^2 + 3 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in terms of \(a\):

\[
a^2 - 4ab + (b^2 + 3) = 0.
\]

Using the quadratic formula, we find the roots:

\[
a = \frac{4b \pm \sqrt{(4b)^2 - 4(b^2 + 3)}}{2}.
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
(4b)^2 - 4(b^2 + 3) = 16b^2 - 4b^2 - 12 = 12b^2 - 12 = 12(b^2 - 1).
\]

Thus, the roots are:

\[
a = \frac{4b \pm 2\sqrt{3(b^2 - 1)}}{2} = 2b \pm \sqrt{3(b^2 - 1)}.
\]

Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, we take the positive root:

\[
a = 2b + \sqrt{3(b^2 - 1)}.
\]

Next, we need to analyze the inequality:

\[
2\sqrt{2ab} - \frac{1}{2}a - b \quad () \quad \frac{1}{2}.
\]

First, we compute \(2\sqrt{2ab}\):

\[
2\sqrt{2ab} = 2\sqrt{2b(2b + \sqrt{3(b^2 - 1)})} = 2\sqrt{4b^2 + 2b\sqrt{3(b^2 - 1)}}.
\]

Now, we simplify the expression \(2\sqrt{2ab} - \frac{1}{2}a - b\):

Substituting \(a\):

\[
= 2\sqrt{2ab} - \frac{1}{2}(2b + \sqrt{3(b^2 - 1)}) - b.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
= 2\sqrt{2ab} - b - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{3(b^2 - 1)}.
\]

Next, we need to analyze the expression \(2\sqrt{2ab} - b - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{3(b^2 - 1)}\) and compare it to \(\frac{1}{2}\).

To do this, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We apply it to the terms \(2\) and \(2ab\):

\[
(1 + 1)(2ab) \geq (2\sqrt{2ab})^2 \implies 2(2ab) \geq 8ab \implies 2\sqrt{2ab} \geq 2\sqrt{ab}.
\]

Now, we need to check if:

\[
2\sqrt{2ab} - b - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{3(b^2 - 1)} \geq \frac{1}{2}.
\]

To analyze this, we can substitute specific values for \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy the original equation. For example, let \(a = b = 1\):

\[
1^2 + 1^2 + 3 = 4(1)(1) \implies 2 + 3 = 4 \quad \text{(True)}.
\]

Now substituting \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\):

\[
2\sqrt{2(1)(1)} - \frac{1}{2}(1) - 1 = 2\sqrt{2} - \frac{1}{2} - 1.
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
2\sqrt{2} - 1.5.
\]

Since \(2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828\), we have:

\[
2\sqrt{2} - 1.5 \approx 1.328 > \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Thus, we can conclude that:

\[
2\sqrt{2ab} - \frac{1}{2}a - b \geq \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
