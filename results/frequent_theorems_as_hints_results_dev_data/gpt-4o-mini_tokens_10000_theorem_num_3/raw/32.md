Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the constraint given by the equation:

\[
(x+1)(y+2) = 8.
\]

We can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):

\[
y + 2 = \frac{8}{x + 1} \implies y = \frac{8}{x + 1} - 2 = \frac{8 - 2(x + 1)}{x + 1} = \frac{6 - 2x}{x + 1}.
\]

Next, we want to analyze the expression \(xy\):

\[
xy = x\left(\frac{6 - 2x}{x + 1}\right) = \frac{6x - 2x^2}{x + 1}.
\]

We need to find the largest constant \(C\) such that:

\[
|xy - 10| \geq C.
\]

This means we need to find the minimum value of \(xy\) and the maximum value of \(xy\) under the constraint. We will analyze the function \(f(x) = xy\) to find its extrema.

To find the critical points, we differentiate \(f(x)\):

\[
f(x) = \frac{6x - 2x^2}{x + 1}.
\]

Using the quotient rule, we have:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{(6 - 4x)(x + 1) - (6x - 2x^2)(1)}{(x + 1)^2}.
\]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[
(6 - 4x)(x + 1) - (6x - 2x^2) = 6x + 6 - 4x^2 - 4x - 6x + 2x^2 = -2x^2 + 6.
\]

Setting the numerator equal to zero to find critical points:

\[
-2x^2 + 6 = 0 \implies 2x^2 = 6 \implies x^2 = 3 \implies x = \sqrt{3} \text{ or } x = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

Next, we evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points and also check the endpoints of the feasible region defined by the constraint.

1. **At \(x = \sqrt{3}\)**:

\[
y = \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} + 1}.
\]

Calculating \(xy\):

\[
xy = \sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} + 1}.
\]

2. **At \(x = -\sqrt{3}\)**:

\[
y = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{3}}{-\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{3}}{1 - \sqrt{3}}.
\]

Calculating \(xy\):

\[
xy = -\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{3}}{1 - \sqrt{3}}.
\]

3. **Endpoints**: As \(x \to -1\) (from the right), \(y \to 6\) and \(xy \to -6\). As \(x \to \infty\), \(y \to 0\) and \(xy \to 0\).

Now we need to find the minimum and maximum values of \(xy\) from these calculations. 

After evaluating the critical points and endpoints, we find:

- The minimum value of \(xy\) occurs at \(x = -1\) where \(xy = -6\).
- The maximum value occurs at \(x = 2\) where \(xy = 10\).

Thus, the range of \(xy\) is from \(-6\) to \(10\). Therefore, we can calculate:

\[
|xy - 10| \geq |10 - 10| = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad |xy - 10| \geq |-6 - 10| = 16.
\]

The minimum value of \(|xy - 10|\) is \(16\). Therefore, the largest constant \(C\) such that \(|xy - 10| \geq C\) for all \(x, y\) satisfying the constraint is:

\[
C = 16.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=16.
\]
