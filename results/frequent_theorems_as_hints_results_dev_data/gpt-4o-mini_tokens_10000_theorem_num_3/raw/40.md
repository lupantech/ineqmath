Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality 

\[
\frac{a+1}{a+b+1}+\frac{b+1}{b+c+1}+\frac{c+1}{c+a+1} \geq C
\]

for non-negative \(a, b, c\) such that \(a + b + c = 3\). Our goal is to find the largest constant \(C\) for which this inequality holds for all valid values of \(a, b, c\).

### Step 1: Simplifying the Expression

We can rewrite each term in the sum:

\[
\frac{a+1}{a+b+1} = 1 - \frac{b}{a+b+1}
\]

Thus, we can express the entire sum as:

\[
\frac{a+1}{a+b+1} + \frac{b+1}{b+c+1} + \frac{c+1}{c+a+1} = 3 - \left( \frac{b}{a+b+1} + \frac{c}{b+c+1} + \frac{a}{c+a+1} \right)
\]

### Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound

To find a lower bound for the sum, we need to analyze the term 

\[
\frac{b}{a+b+1} + \frac{c}{b+c+1} + \frac{a}{c+a+1}.
\]

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
\left( \frac{b}{a+b+1} + \frac{c}{b+c+1} + \frac{a}{c+a+1} \right) \left( (a+b+1) + (b+c+1) + (c+a+1) \right) \geq (a+b+c)^2.
\]

Calculating the second factor:

\[
(a+b+1) + (b+c+1) + (c+a+1) = 2(a+b+c) + 3 = 2 \cdot 3 + 3 = 9.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\left( \frac{b}{a+b+1} + \frac{c}{b+c+1} + \frac{a}{c+a+1} \right) \cdot 9 \geq 9.
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{b}{a+b+1} + \frac{c}{b+c+1} + \frac{a}{c+a+1} \geq 1.
\]

### Step 3: Putting It All Together

Substituting this back into our expression, we find:

\[
\frac{a+1}{a+b+1} + \frac{b+1}{b+c+1} + \frac{c+1}{c+a+1} \geq 3 - 1 = 2.
\]

### Step 4: Checking for Equality

To check if \(C = 2\) is achievable, we can set \(a = b = c = 1\):

\[
\frac{1+1}{1+1+1} + \frac{1+1}{1+1+1} + \frac{1+1}{1+1+1} = 3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = 2.
\]

Thus, the equality holds when \(a = b = c = 1\).

### Conclusion

Since we have shown that the inequality holds for all non-negative \(a, b, c\) summing to 3, and we have found that the minimum value of the left-hand side is exactly 2, we conclude that the largest constant \(C\) for which the inequality holds is:

\[
\boxed{2}.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is \(C=2\).
