Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( abc = 1 \).

### Step 1: Apply the AM-GM Inequality

We can use the AM-GM inequality, which states that for any positive real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \):

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq (x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n)^{\frac{1}{n}}
\]

In our case, we can set \( x_1 = \frac{1}{a}, x_2 = \frac{1}{b}, x_3 = \frac{1}{c} \). Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}}{3} \geq \left(\frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{c}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Right Side

Since \( abc = 1 \), we can express \( \frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{c} \) as:

\[
\frac{1}{abc} = 1
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{c}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} = 1^{\frac{1}{3}} = 1
\]

### Step 3: Apply the AM-GM Result

Substituting this back into our inequality gives:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}}{3} \geq 1
\]

Multiplying both sides by 3, we obtain:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq 3
\]

### Step 4: Determine the Largest Constant \( C \)

From the above inequality, we see that the left-hand side is always greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) with \( abc = 1 \) is \( C = 3 \).

### Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) satisfying the inequality is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=3.
\]
