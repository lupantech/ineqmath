Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given constraint:

\[
(a+b)(1+4ab) = 2.
\]

We need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
ab(a+b+ab) \leq C
\]

holds for all non-negative \( a \) and \( b \) satisfying the constraint.

### Step 1: Analyze the constraint

We can rewrite the constraint as:

\[
(a+b) + 4ab(a+b) = 2.
\]

Let \( s = a + b \) and \( p = ab \). Then the constraint becomes:

\[
s + 4ps = 2.
\]

From this, we can express \( s \):

\[
s(1 + 4p) = 2 \implies s = \frac{2}{1 + 4p}.
\]

### Step 2: Express the target inequality

We need to analyze the expression \( ab(a+b+ab) \):

\[
ab(a+b+ab) = p\left(s + p\right) = p\left(\frac{2}{1 + 4p} + p\right).
\]

Substituting \( s \):

\[
ab(a+b+ab) = p\left(\frac{2 + p(1 + 4p)}{1 + 4p}\right) = \frac{p(2 + p + 4p^2)}{1 + 4p}.
\]

### Step 3: Find the maximum of the expression

To find the maximum of \( ab(a+b+ab) \), we need to analyze the function:

\[
f(p) = \frac{p(2 + p + 4p^2)}{1 + 4p}.
\]

We will find the critical points by differentiating \( f(p) \) and setting the derivative to zero. However, it is often easier to evaluate \( f(p) \) at specific values of \( p \) that satisfy the constraint.

### Step 4: Evaluate at specific points

1. **Case \( a = b \)**: Let \( a = b = x \). Then \( s = 2x \) and \( p = x^2 \). The constraint becomes:

   \[
   (2x)(1 + 4x^2) = 2 \implies 2x + 8x^3 = 2 \implies 8x^3 + 2x - 2 = 0.
   \]

   Dividing by 2:

   \[
   4x^3 + x - 1 = 0.
   \]

   We can find the roots of this cubic equation. By testing \( x = 0.5 \):

   \[
   4(0.5)^3 + 0.5 - 1 = 4(0.125) + 0.5 - 1 = 0.5 + 0.5 - 1 = 0.
   \]

   Thus, \( x = 0.5 \) is a root. Therefore, \( a = b = 0.5 \) gives:

   \[
   ab(a+b+ab) = (0.5)(0.5)(1 + 0.5) = 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 1.5 = 0.375.
   \]

2. **Case \( a = 0 \) or \( b = 0 \)**: If either \( a \) or \( b \) is zero, then \( ab(a+b+ab) = 0 \).

### Step 5: Conclusion

The maximum value of \( ab(a+b+ab) \) occurs at \( a = b = 0.5 \) and is equal to \( 0.375 \). Therefore, the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a, b \) satisfying the constraint is:

\[
C = 0.375.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C = 0.375.
\]
