$$

Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression 

\[
S = \frac{1}{1+a^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+b)} + \frac{1}{1+c^2}
\]

under the constraint \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1 \) with \( a, b, c \geq 0 \). Our goal is to find the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
S \geq C
\]

for all valid \( a, b, c \).

### Step 1: Analyze the terms in \( S \)

1. **First term**: \( \frac{1}{1+a^2} \)
   - This term decreases as \( a^2 \) increases. The maximum occurs when \( a = 0 \), giving \( \frac{1}{1+0} = 1 \).

2. **Second term**: \( \frac{1}{3(1+b)} \)
   - This term decreases as \( b \) increases. The maximum occurs when \( b = 0 \), giving \( \frac{1}{3(1+0)} = \frac{1}{3} \).

3. **Third term**: \( \frac{1}{1+c^2} \)
   - Similar to the first term, this term decreases as \( c^2 \) increases. The maximum occurs when \( c = 0 \), giving \( \frac{1}{1+0} = 1 \).

### Step 2: Consider the case when \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 1 \)

Substituting \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 1 \) into the constraint \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1 \):

\[
0^2 + 0 + 1^2 = 1
\]

Calculating \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{1}{1+0^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+0)} + \frac{1}{1+1^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2}
\]

Calculating \( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{6} + \frac{3}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

Thus,

\[
S = 1 + \frac{5}{6} = \frac{11}{6}
\]

### Step 3: Consider the case when \( a = 1 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \)

Substituting \( a = 1 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \):

\[
1^2 + 0 + 0^2 = 1
\]

Calculating \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{1}{1+1^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+0)} + \frac{1}{1+0^2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + 1
\]

Calculating \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + 1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

Thus,

\[
S = \frac{5}{6} + 1 = \frac{11}{6}
\]

### Step 4: Consider the case when \( a = 0 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 0 \)

Substituting \( a = 0 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = 0 \):

\[
0^2 + 1 + 0^2 = 1
\]

Calculating \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{1}{1+0^2} + \frac{1}{3(1+1)} + \frac{1}{1+0^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{6} + 1 = 2 + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{13}{6}
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion

The minimum value of \( S \) occurs in the cases where \( a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 \) or \( a = 0, b = 0, c = 1 \), both yielding \( S = \frac{11}{6} \).

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that 

\[
S \geq C
\]

for all \( a, b, c \) satisfying the constraint is 

\[
C = \frac{11}{6}.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C = \frac{11}{6}.
\]
