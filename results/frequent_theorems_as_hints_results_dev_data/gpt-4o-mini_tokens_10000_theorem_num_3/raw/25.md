Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{4}{c}+\frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c+d}
\]

for the largest constant \( C \), we will apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

### Step 1: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we can relate the sums on the left-hand side to the sum on the right-hand side. We can express the left-hand side as follows:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \right) \left( a + b + c + d \right) \geq \left( 1 + 1 + 4 + 16 \right)^2
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
1 + 1 + 4 + 16 = 22
\]
\[
22^2 = 484
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \right) (a + b + c + d) \geq 484
\]

### Step 2: Rearranging the Inequality

From the above result, we can rearrange it to find:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{484}{a + b + c + d}
\]

This implies that we can take \( C = 484 \).

### Step 3: Verify if \( C = 484 \) is the Largest Constant

To check if \( C = 484 \) is indeed the largest constant, we need to consider if equality can be achieved in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz holds when the ratios of the corresponding terms are equal:

\[
\frac{1/a}{1} = \frac{1/b}{1} = \frac{4/c}{4} = \frac{16/d}{16}
\]

This leads to the conditions:

\[
\frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{b} = \frac{4}{c} = \frac{16}{d}
\]

Let \( k = \frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{b} \), then:

\[
a = b = \frac{1}{k}, \quad c = \frac{4}{k}, \quad d = \frac{16}{k}
\]

Substituting these values back into the inequality confirms that the left-hand side equals the right-hand side when \( C = 484 \).

### Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c, d \) is 

\[
\boxed{484}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is \( C=484 \).
