Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality 

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \quad () \quad 1
\]

given the constraint 

\[
a + b + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 10.
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the constraint

We can rewrite the constraint as follows:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 10 - (a + b).
\]

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \geq \frac{(a + b)^2}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}.
\]

This implies:

\[
a^2 + b^2 \geq \frac{(a + b)^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 2: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

Using Cauchy-Schwarz directly on the terms \( \frac{1}{a} \) and \( \frac{2}{b} \):

\[
\left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \right)(a + 2b) \geq (1 + 2)^2 = 9.
\]

This gives us:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \geq \frac{9}{a + 2b}.
\]

### Step 3: Relate \( a + 2b \) to the constraint

From the constraint \( a + b + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 10 \), we can derive bounds for \( a + 2b \). 

Let \( s = a + b \) and \( t = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). Then we have:

\[
s + t \leq 10.
\]

Using the identity \( t^2 = a^2 + b^2 \) and the fact that \( t \geq \frac{s^2}{2} \) (from Cauchy-Schwarz), we can derive:

\[
s + \frac{s^2}{2} \leq 10.
\]

This is a quadratic inequality in \( s \):

\[
\frac{s^2}{2} + s - 10 \leq 0.
\]

### Step 4: Solve the quadratic inequality

Multiplying through by 2 gives:

\[
s^2 + 2s - 20 \leq 0.
\]

The roots of the equation \( s^2 + 2s - 20 = 0 \) are:

\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 80}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{21}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{21}.
\]

The positive root is \( s = -1 + \sqrt{21} \approx 3.58 \). Thus, \( s \) must satisfy:

\[
0 < s \leq -1 + \sqrt{21}.
\]

### Step 5: Find bounds for \( a + 2b \)

Since \( b = s - a \), we can express \( a + 2b = a + 2(s - a) = 2s - a \). The maximum occurs when \( a \) is minimized, which happens when \( a \) approaches 0. Thus, we can estimate:

\[
a + 2b \leq 2(-1 + \sqrt{21}) \approx 2(3.58) \approx 7.16.
\]

### Step 6: Final inequality

Now we can return to our inequality:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \geq \frac{9}{a + 2b}.
\]

Given that \( a + 2b \) can be at most \( 7.16 \), we have:

\[
\frac{9}{a + 2b} \geq \frac{9}{7.16} \approx 1.26.
\]

Thus, we conclude:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \geq 1.26 > 1.
\]

### Conclusion

Therefore, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} > 1.
\]

Thus, the answer is:

The answer is (E) $>$.
