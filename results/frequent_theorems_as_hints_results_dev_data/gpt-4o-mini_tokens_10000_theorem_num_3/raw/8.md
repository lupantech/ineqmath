Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum value of the product \( abc \) under the constraints \( a + b + c = 2 \) and \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the constraints

From the first constraint, we have:
\[
a + b + c = 2.
\]

From the second constraint, we can use the identity:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + ac + bc).
\]
Substituting \( a + b + c = 2 \) into this identity gives:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2^2 - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 4 - 2(ab + ac + bc).
\]
Setting this equal to the second constraint \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2 \), we have:
\[
4 - 2(ab + ac + bc) = 2.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2 = 2(ab + ac + bc) \implies ab + ac + bc = 1.
\]

### Step 2: Use the method of Lagrange multipliers

We want to maximize \( abc \) subject to the constraints \( a + b + c = 2 \) and \( ab + ac + bc = 1 \). 

### Step 3: Use symmetry and substitution

Given the symmetry of the problem, we can assume \( a \leq b \leq c \). We can express \( c \) in terms of \( a \) and \( b \):
\[
c = 2 - a - b.
\]
Substituting this into the second constraint gives:
\[
ab + a(2 - a - b) + b(2 - a - b) = 1.
\]
Expanding this, we have:
\[
ab + 2a - a^2 - ab + 2b - ab - b^2 = 1 \implies 2a + 2b - a^2 - b^2 - ab = 1.
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + ab - 2a - 2b + 1 = 0.
\]

### Step 4: Solve for critical points

To find the maximum of \( abc \), we can also use the method of Lagrange multipliers or directly analyze the function. However, we can also check specific cases.

### Step 5: Check specific cases

1. **Case 1**: Let \( a = b = c \). Then \( 3a = 2 \) gives \( a = \frac{2}{3} \). Thus:
   \[
   abc = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{27}.
   \]

2. **Case 2**: Let \( a = 0 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 1 \). Then:
   \[
   abc = 0.
   \]

3. **Case 3**: Let \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 0 \). Then:
   \[
   abc = 0.
   \]

4. **Case 4**: Let \( a = 1 \), \( b = 0.5 \), \( c = 0.5 \). Then:
   \[
   abc = 1 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.25.
   \]

### Step 6: Conclusion

The maximum value of \( abc \) occurs when \( a = b = c = \frac{2}{3} \), yielding:
\[
abc = \frac{8}{27}.
\]

Thus, the minimal constant \( C \) such that \( abc \leq C \) for all \( a, b, c \) satisfying the constraints is:
\[
C = \frac{8}{27}.
\]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\text{The answer is } C = \frac{8}{27}.
\]
