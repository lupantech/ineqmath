Problem: Given the real number $b \leq 2$, find the largest constant $C$ such that for all positive real numbers $x, y$ where $xy = 1$, the following inequality holds:
$$
\frac{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}{C}+\frac{b}{x+y} \geq 1+\frac{b}{2}
$$

Please use some of the following theorems to solve the problem:
Theorem 1 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: mean inequalities): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers. The numbers
$$
\begin{aligned}
& Q M=\sqrt{\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n}}, \quad A M=\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\
& G M=\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \quad \text { and } \quad H M=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
are called the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric and harmonic mean for the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, respectively, and we have
$$
Q M \geq A M \geq G M \geq H M
$$

Equalities occur if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{n}$.

Theorem 2 (Category: Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, Nicknames: cauchy-schwarz inequality): Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{1}, b_{2}$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ be real numbers. Then we have
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}^{2}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}^{2}\right) \geq\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} b_{i}\right)^{2}
$$
i.e.
$$
\left(a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\right)\left(b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}^{2}\right) \geq\left(a_{1} b_{1}+a_{2} b_{2}+\cdots+a_{n} b_{n}\right)^{2}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if the sequences $\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right)$ and $\left(b_{1}, b_{2}\right.$, $\ldots, b_{n}$ ) are proportional, i.e. $\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}=\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}=\cdots=\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}$.

Theorem 3 (Category: Inequality Between Means, Nicknames: am-gm (arithmetic mean-geometric mean) inequality, am-gm): If $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ are nonnegative real numbers, then

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i} \geq\left(a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}
$$

with equality if and only if $a_{1}=a_{2}=\ldots=a_{n}$. This inequality is a special case of the Power Mean Inequality.

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}{C} + \frac{b}{x+y} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( xy = 1 \) and \( b \leq 2 \).

### Step 1: Express \( y \) in terms of \( x \)

Since \( xy = 1 \), we can express \( y \) as \( y = \frac{1}{x} \). Thus, we can rewrite the inequality in terms of \( x \):

\[
\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2}}{C} + \frac{b}{x + \frac{1}{x}} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the terms

First, we simplify \( \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2} \):

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{x^4 + 1}{x^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{x^4 + 1}}{x}
\]

Next, we simplify \( x + \frac{1}{x} \):

\[
x + \frac{1}{x} \geq 2 \quad \text{(by AM-GM inequality)}
\]

### Step 3: Substitute back into the inequality

Substituting these into the inequality gives:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{x^4 + 1}}{Cx} + \frac{b}{x + \frac{1}{x}} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the inequality

Let \( t = x + \frac{1}{x} \). From the AM-GM inequality, we know \( t \geq 2 \). We can express \( \sqrt{x^4 + 1} \) in terms of \( t \):

\[
x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = t^2 - 2 \implies \sqrt{x^4 + 1} = \sqrt{(x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2})^2 - 2} = \sqrt{(t^2 - 2)^2 + 1}
\]

### Step 5: Find the minimum value of the left-hand side

To find the largest \( C \), we need to analyze the left-hand side of the inequality:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{(t^2 - 2)^2 + 1}}{C} + \frac{b}{t}
\]

We want this to be greater than or equal to \( 1 + \frac{b}{2} \). 

### Step 6: Set \( b = 2 \) for the worst case

To find the largest \( C \), we can set \( b = 2 \) (the maximum value allowed). The inequality becomes:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{(t^2 - 2)^2 + 1}}{C} + \frac{2}{t} \geq 2
\]

### Step 7: Analyze the case when \( t = 2 \)

When \( t = 2 \):

\[
\frac{\sqrt{(2^2 - 2)^2 + 1}}{C} + 1 \geq 2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{1}}{C} + 1 \geq 2 \implies \frac{1}{C} \geq 1 \implies C \leq 1
\]

### Step 8: Check if \( C = 1 \) works

Now we check if \( C = 1 \) satisfies the original inequality for all \( b \leq 2 \):

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + \frac{b}{x+y} \geq 1 + \frac{b}{2}
\]

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\[
(x+y)^2 \leq 2(x^2 + y^2) \implies x^2 + y^2 \geq \frac{(x+y)^2}{2}
\]

Thus, we can conclude that \( C = 1 \) is indeed the largest constant satisfying the inequality.

### Conclusion

The largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( x, y \) with \( xy = 1 \) and \( b \leq 2 \) is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=1
\]
