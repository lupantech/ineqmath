## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given inequality:

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) \geq C
\]

where \( x + y = 1 \) and \( x, y > 0 \).

First, we can rewrite the left-hand side of the inequality:

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) = \left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1}{1-x}\right)
\]

Next, we expand this expression:

\[
= \left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1}{1-x}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x} + \frac{1}{x(1-x)}
\]

Now, we simplify the terms:

\[
= 1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x} + \frac{1}{x(1-x)}
\]

To find a lower bound for this expression, we will analyze the terms \( \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x} \). By applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x}\right)(x + (1-x)) \geq (1 + 1)^2 = 4
\]

Since \( x + (1-x) = 1 \), it follows that:

\[
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x} \geq 4
\]

Thus, we can substitute this back into our expression:

\[
1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{1-x} + \frac{1}{x(1-x)} \geq 1 + 4 + \frac{1}{x(1-x)}
\]

Next, we need to analyze \( \frac{1}{x(1-x)} \). The function \( x(1-x) \) reaches its maximum when \( x = \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
x(1-x) = x - x^2
\]

The maximum value occurs at \( x = \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
\frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the minimum value of \( \frac{1}{x(1-x)} \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}} = 4
\]

Now we can substitute this back into our inequality:

\[
1 + 4 + 4 = 9
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{y}\right) \geq 9
\]

This shows that the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( x \) and \( y \) satisfying \( x + y = 1 \) is:

\[
C = 9
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=9
\]
