## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality given the condition \( a + b + c \geq \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a} \).

First, let's denote the left-hand side of the inequality we want to analyze as:

\[
S = \frac{a}{2a+1} + \frac{b}{b+1} + \frac{c}{c+1}.
\]

We will compare \( S \) with \( 2 \).

### Step 1: Analyze each term in \( S \)

1. **For the term \( \frac{a}{2a+1} \)**:
   - We can rewrite it as:
   \[
   \frac{a}{2a+1} = \frac{a}{2a} \cdot \frac{2a}{2a+1} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2a}{2a+1}.
   \]
   - The term \( \frac{2a}{2a+1} < 1 \) for all \( a > 0 \), hence \( \frac{a}{2a+1} < \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **For the term \( \frac{b}{b+1} \)**:
   - This can be analyzed similarly:
   \[
   \frac{b}{b+1} < 1 \text{ for all } b > 0.
   \]

3. **For the term \( \frac{c}{c+1} \)**:
   - Again, we have:
   \[
   \frac{c}{c+1} < 1 \text{ for all } c > 0.
   \]

### Step 2: Combine the inequalities

Now, we can combine our findings:

\[
S = \frac{a}{2a+1} + \frac{b}{b+1} + \frac{c}{c+1} < \frac{1}{2} + 1 + 1 = \frac{1}{2} + 2 = 2.5.
\]

### Step 3: Establish a lower bound for \( S \)

To establish a more rigorous bound, we can analyze the terms more closely. 

- The term \( \frac{a}{2a+1} \) approaches \( \frac{1}{2} \) as \( a \) becomes large, but it is always less than \( \frac{1}{2} \).
- The terms \( \frac{b}{b+1} \) and \( \frac{c}{c+1} \) approach \( 1 \) as \( b \) and \( c \) become large, but they are always less than \( 1 \).

Thus, we can conclude that:

\[
S < 2.
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion

Given that \( S < 2 \), we can fill in the blank in the inequality:

\[
\frac{a}{2a+1} + \frac{b}{b+1} + \frac{c}{c+1} \quad < \quad 2.
\]

Thus, the correct option is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
