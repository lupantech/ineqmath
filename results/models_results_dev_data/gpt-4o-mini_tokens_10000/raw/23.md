Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the maximal constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{a}{1+2b^3} + \frac{b}{1+2c^3} + \frac{c}{1+2a^3} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( a + b + c = 3 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the expression

We start by analyzing the left-hand side of the inequality. Each term \( \frac{a}{1 + 2b^3} \) can be interpreted as a fraction where the numerator is a positive number and the denominator is also positive. 

### Step 2: Use symmetry and test cases

Given the symmetry in the variables \( a, b, c \), we can test specific cases to find a lower bound for the expression. A natural case to consider is when \( a = b = c = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 1^3} + \frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 1^3} + \frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 1^3} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{1 + 2} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 1.
\]

This suggests that \( C \leq 1 \).

### Step 3: Show that \( C = 1 \) is achievable

Next, we need to show that \( C = 1 \) is indeed achievable for all positive \( a, b, c \) such that \( a + b + c = 3 \). 

To do this, we will use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We can apply it as follows:

\[
\left( \frac{a}{1 + 2b^3} + \frac{b}{1 + 2c^3} + \frac{c}{1 + 2a^3} \right) \left( (1 + 2b^3) + (1 + 2c^3) + (1 + 2a^3) \right) \geq (a + b + c)^2.
\]

Calculating the second factor:

\[
(1 + 2b^3) + (1 + 2c^3) + (1 + 2a^3) = 3 + 2(b^3 + c^3 + a^3).
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\left( \frac{a}{1 + 2b^3} + \frac{b}{1 + 2c^3} + \frac{c}{1 + 2a^3} \right) (3 + 2(b^3 + c^3 + a^3)) \geq 9.
\]

### Step 4: Bound \( b^3 + c^3 + a^3 \)

Using the Power Mean inequality, we know that:

\[
\frac{a + b + c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies 1 \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies abc \leq 1.
\]

By the AM-GM inequality, we also have:

\[
b^3 + c^3 + a^3 \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{abc} \geq 3.
\]

Thus, we can conclude that \( b^3 + c^3 + a^3 \) is bounded above by \( 3 \) when \( a + b + c = 3 \).

### Step 5: Final calculation

Substituting back, we find:

\[
\left( \frac{a}{1 + 2b^3} + \frac{b}{1 + 2c^3} + \frac{c}{1 + 2a^3} \right) (3 + 2 \cdot 3) \geq 9 \implies \left( \frac{a}{1 + 2b^3} + \frac{b}{1 + 2c^3} + \frac{c}{1 + 2a^3} \right) \cdot 9 \geq 9.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{a}{1 + 2b^3} + \frac{b}{1 + 2c^3} + \frac{c}{1 + 2a^3} \geq 1.
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, we have shown that the maximal constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) with \( a + b + c = 3 \) is indeed \( C = 1 \).

The answer is \( C = 1 \). Therefore, we conclude:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=1.
