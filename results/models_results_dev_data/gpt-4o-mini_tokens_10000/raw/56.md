## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression 

\[
S = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i+n}{1+x_i^2}
\]

and compare it to \( n^2 + n \).

### Step 1: Simplifying the Expression

We can rewrite the term inside the summation:

\[
\frac{x_i+n}{1+x_i^2} = \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} + \frac{n}{1+x_i^2}
\]

Thus, we can express \( S \) as:

\[
S = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{1+x_i^2}
\]

### Step 2: Analyzing Each Component

1. **Analyzing \( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} \)**:

   We know that \( x_i > 0 \) and \( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1 \). The function \( f(x) = \frac{x}{1+x^2} \) is increasing for \( x > 0 \). Therefore, we can apply Jensen's inequality since \( f \) is concave down for \( x > 0 \).

   By Jensen's inequality:

   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} \leq n \cdot \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i/n}{1 + (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i/n)^2} = n \cdot \frac{1/n}{1 + (1/n)^2} = n \cdot \frac{1/n}{1 + 1/n^2} = \frac{n}{n + 1}
   \]

2. **Analyzing \( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{1+x_i^2} \)**:

   Since \( x_i > 0 \), we have \( 1 + x_i^2 > 1 \), thus \( \frac{n}{1+x_i^2} < n \). Therefore:

   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{1+x_i^2} < n^2
   \]

### Step 3: Combining the Results

Now we combine the results from both components:

\[
S = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{1+x_i^2} + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{1+x_i^2} < \frac{n}{n + 1} + n^2
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with \( n^2 + n \)

We need to compare \( S \) with \( n^2 + n \):

1. The term \( \frac{n}{n + 1} \) is less than \( n \) for \( n > 0 \).
2. Therefore, we can conclude that:

\[
S < n^2 + n
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, we have shown that:

\[
S < n^2 + n
\]

The correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
