## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition:

\[
4abc = a + b + c + 1.
\]

We need to analyze the inequality:

\[
\frac{b^2+c^2}{2a} + \frac{c^2+a^2}{3b} + \frac{b^2+a^2}{c} \quad () \quad 2(ab + bc + ca).
\]

Let's denote:

\[
S = \frac{b^2+c^2}{2a} + \frac{c^2+a^2}{3b} + \frac{b^2+a^2}{c}.
\]

We will compare \( S \) with \( 2(ab + bc + ca) \).

### Step 1: Analyze \( S \)

We can rewrite each term in \( S \):

1. The first term \( \frac{b^2+c^2}{2a} \) can be interpreted as the average of \( b^2 \) and \( c^2 \) scaled by \( \frac{1}{2a} \).
2. The second term \( \frac{c^2+a^2}{3b} \) is the average of \( c^2 \) and \( a^2 \) scaled by \( \frac{1}{3b} \).
3. The third term \( \frac{b^2+a^2}{c} \) is the average of \( b^2 \) and \( a^2 \) scaled by \( \frac{1}{c} \).

### Step 2: Use Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to each term in \( S \):

1. For the first term:
   \[
   \frac{b^2+c^2}{2a} \geq \frac{(b+c)^2}{2a \cdot 2} = \frac{(b+c)^2}{4a}.
   \]

2. For the second term:
   \[
   \frac{c^2+a^2}{3b} \geq \frac{(c+a)^2}{3b \cdot 2} = \frac{(c+a)^2}{6b}.
   \]

3. For the third term:
   \[
   \frac{b^2+a^2}{c} \geq \frac{(b+a)^2}{2c}.
   \]

### Step 3: Combine the Inequalities

Now, we can combine these inequalities to get a lower bound for \( S \):

\[
S \geq \frac{(b+c)^2}{4a} + \frac{(c+a)^2}{6b} + \frac{(b+a)^2}{2c}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with \( 2(ab + bc + ca) \)

To show that \( S \) is less than or equal to \( 2(ab + bc + ca) \), we can use the condition \( 4abc = a + b + c + 1 \) to find relationships between \( a, b, c \).

### Step 5: Test with Specific Values

Letâ€™s test with specific values to see if we can find a counterexample or confirm the inequality. 

Let \( a = b = c = 1 \):

\[
4(1)(1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \implies 4 = 4 \quad \text{(holds true)}.
\]

Now calculate \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{1^2 + 1^2}{2 \cdot 1} + \frac{1^2 + 1^2}{3 \cdot 1} + \frac{1^2 + 1^2}{1} = \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{3} + 2 = 1 + \frac{2}{3} + 2 = \frac{3}{3} + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{6}{3} = \frac{11}{3}.
\]

Now calculate \( 2(ab + bc + ca) \):

\[
2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) = 2(3) = 6.
\]

### Conclusion

Since \( S = \frac{11}{3} \) and \( 2(ab + bc + ca) = 6 \), we have:

\[
\frac{11}{3} < 6.
\]

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
S < 2(ab + bc + ca).
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
