Problem: Given non-negative real numbers $a, b, c$ satisfying $ab + bc + ca = 1$, find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$:

$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{c}{\sqrt{a+b+3c}} + \frac{a}{\sqrt{c+b+3a}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{a+c+3b}} \geq C
\]

holds for all non-negative real numbers \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( ab + bc + ca = 1 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the expression

We start by analyzing the left-hand side of the inequality. Each term in the sum has the form 

\[
\frac{x}{\sqrt{y + z + 3x}}
\]

where \( x, y, z \) are permutations of \( a, b, c \). 

### Step 2: Consider specific cases

To find a lower bound for the left-hand side, we can consider specific cases for \( a, b, c \).

#### Case 1: \( a = b = 0 \), \( c = 1 \)

In this case, we have:

\[
ab + bc + ca = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \quad \text{(not valid since it must equal 1)}
\]

#### Case 2: \( a = b = c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \)

This satisfies \( ab + bc + ca = 3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = 1 \).

Calculating the left-hand side:

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}{\sqrt{\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} + \frac{3}{\sqrt{3}}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}{\sqrt{\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

Thus, the left-hand side becomes:

\[
3 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

### Step 3: General case

To find the largest \( C \), we need to ensure that 

\[
\frac{3}{\sqrt{5}} \geq C.
\]

### Step 4: Finding the maximum \( C \)

We can compute \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{5}} \):

\[
\frac{3}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5}.
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion

Since we have shown that the left-hand side can achieve the value \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{5}} \) under the condition \( ab + bc + ca = 1 \), we conclude that the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all non-negative \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( ab + bc + ca = 1 \) is 

\[
C = \frac{3}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C = \frac{3}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]
