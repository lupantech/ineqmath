## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition:

\[
c^2 + d^2 = (a^2 + b^2)^3.
\]

We need to analyze the expression:

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d}
\]

and compare it to 1.

### Step 1: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the following form:

\[
\left( \frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \right) \left( c^2 + d^2 \right) \geq (a^2 + b^2)^2.
\]

### Step 2: Substitute the Given Condition

From the problem, we know that:

\[
c^2 + d^2 = (a^2 + b^2)^3.
\]

Substituting this into the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives:

\[
\left( \frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \right) (a^2 + b^2)^3 \geq (a^2 + b^2)^2.
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the Inequality

Dividing both sides by \((a^2 + b^2)^3\) (which is positive since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive):

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \geq \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{(a^2 + b^2)^3} = \frac{1}{a^2 + b^2}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the Result

Now we have:

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \geq \frac{1}{a^2 + b^2}.
\]

To compare this with 1, we need to analyze the term \(\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2}\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, \(a^2 + b^2\) is also positive, and thus \(\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2} \leq 1\) if \(a^2 + b^2 \geq 1\).

### Step 5: Consider the Case When \(a^2 + b^2 < 1\)

If \(a^2 + b^2 < 1\), then \(\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2} > 1\). In this case, we cannot conclude that \(\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \leq 1\).

### Conclusion

Thus, we can conclude that:

- If \(a^2 + b^2 \geq 1\), then \(\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \geq 1\).
- If \(a^2 + b^2 < 1\), then \(\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} > 1\).

Since we cannot definitively say that \(\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \leq 1\) in all cases, the most appropriate conclusion is that:

\[
\frac{a^3}{c} + \frac{b^3}{d} \geq 1.
\]

Thus, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
