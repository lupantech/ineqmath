## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{C}{a+b+c+d}
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c, d \).

### Step 1: Analyze the inequality

We can rewrite the inequality as:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \cdot (a + b + c + d) \geq C
\]

This suggests that we need to find a way to relate the left-hand side to the right-hand side in a meaningful way.

### Step 2: Use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the following form:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \right) (a + b + c + d) \geq (1 + 1 + 4 + 16)^2
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
1 + 1 + 4 + 16 = 22
\]
\[
(1 + 1 + 4 + 16)^2 = 22^2 = 484
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \right) (a + b + c + d) \geq 484
\]

### Step 3: Rearranging the inequality

From the Cauchy-Schwarz result, we can rearrange it to find:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} \geq \frac{484}{a + b + c + d}
\]

This implies that we can take \( C = 484 \).

### Step 4: Verify if \( C = 484 \) is the largest possible value

To check if \( C = 484 \) is indeed the largest constant, we can consider specific cases for \( a, b, c, d \) to see if the inequality holds.

1. Let \( a = b = c = d = 1 \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{4}{1} + \frac{16}{1} = 1 + 1 + 4 + 16 = 22
   \]
   \[
   a + b + c + d = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
   \]
   \[
   \frac{C}{a+b+c+d} = \frac{C}{4}
   \]
   Thus, we need \( 22 \geq \frac{C}{4} \) or \( C \leq 88 \).

2. Let \( a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d \to 0 \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{4}{1} + \frac{16}{d} \to \infty
   \]
   \[
   a + b + c + d \to 3
   \]
   This case does not provide a useful bound.

3. Let \( a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = 1 \) again confirms \( C = 88 \).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the inequality and applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we find that the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c, d \) is:

\[
\boxed{88}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

The answer is \( C=88 \).
