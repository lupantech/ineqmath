## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4.
\]

We need to analyze the expression:

\[
S = \frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d}
\]

and determine its relationship to \(\frac{5}{4}\).

### Step 1: Analyze the function

The function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{5-x}\) is a decreasing function for \(x < 5\). Therefore, to maximize \(S\), we need to minimize \(a, b, c, d\) under the constraint \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4\).

### Step 2: Use Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) \geq (a + b + c + d)^2.
\]

Substituting \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4\) gives:

\[
4 \cdot 4 \geq (a + b + c + d)^2 \implies 16 \geq (a + b + c + d)^2 \implies 4 \geq |a + b + c + d|.
\]

Thus, we can conclude:

\[
-a - b - c - d \leq 4.
\]

### Step 3: Consider the case when \(a = b = c = d\)

Let \(a = b = c = d = x\). Then:

\[
4x^2 = 4 \implies x^2 = 1 \implies x = 1 \text{ or } x = -1.
\]

If \(x = 1\):

\[
S = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5-1} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 1.
\]

If \(x = -1\):

\[
S = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5 - (-1)} = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the maximum of \(S\)

The maximum value of \(S\) occurs when \(x = 1\), giving \(S = 1\). 

### Step 5: Compare \(S\) with \(\frac{5}{4}\)

Since \(S\) can reach a maximum of \(1\) and \(\frac{5}{4} = 1.25\), we have:

\[
S \leq 1 < \frac{5}{4}.
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

\[
\frac{1}{5-a} + \frac{1}{5-b} + \frac{1}{5-c} + \frac{1}{5-d} < \frac{5}{4}.
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
