Problem: Given four real numbers $a, b, c, d \geq 0$ satisfying $a \geq b + 7c + d$, find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$:

$$
7(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a) \geq C a b c d
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
7(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a) \geq C a b c d
\]

holds for all non-negative real numbers \( a, b, c, d \) satisfying \( a \geq b + 7c + d \).

### Step 1: Analyze the inequality

We start by rewriting the left-hand side:

\[
(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a)
\]

This expression is symmetric in \( a, b, c, d \). We will analyze the inequality under the constraint \( a \geq b + 7c + d \).

### Step 2: Test specific values

To find the largest \( C \), we can test specific values of \( a, b, c, d \) that satisfy the constraint. 

Let’s set \( b = 0 \), \( c = 0 \), and \( d = 0 \). Then, we have:

\[
a \geq 0
\]

In this case, the left-hand side becomes:

\[
7(a+0)(0+0)(0+0)(0+a) = 0
\]

The right-hand side becomes:

\[
C a \cdot 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 = 0
\]

This does not provide any information about \( C \).

### Step 3: Choose non-zero values

Next, let’s choose \( b = 0 \), \( c = 1 \), and \( d = 0 \). Then, we have:

\[
a \geq 0 + 7 \cdot 1 + 0 = 7
\]

Let’s set \( a = 7 \). Now we compute both sides:

Left-hand side:

\[
7(7+0)(0+1)(1+0)(0+7) = 7 \cdot 7 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 7 = 343
\]

Right-hand side:

\[
C \cdot 7 \cdot 0 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 0
\]

Again, this does not provide information about \( C \).

### Step 4: Choose more values

Let’s try \( a = 7 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 1 \), and \( d = 1 \). Then, we have:

\[
a \geq b + 7c + d \implies 7 \geq 1 + 7 \cdot 1 + 1 = 9
\]

This does not satisfy the constraint. 

### Step 5: Find a valid combination

Let’s try \( a = 8 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 1 \), and \( d = 1 \):

\[
a \geq b + 7c + d \implies 8 \geq 1 + 7 \cdot 1 + 1 = 9
\]

This still does not satisfy the constraint.

### Step 6: Use a valid combination

Let’s try \( a = 8 \), \( b = 0 \), \( c = 1 \), and \( d = 0 \):

\[
a \geq b + 7c + d \implies 8 \geq 0 + 7 \cdot 1 + 0 = 7
\]

Now we compute both sides:

Left-hand side:

\[
7(8+0)(0+1)(1+0)(0+8) = 7 \cdot 8 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 8 = 448
\]

Right-hand side:

\[
C \cdot 8 \cdot 0 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 0
\]

### Step 7: General case

To find the largest \( C \), we can use the AM-GM inequality. 

Using AM-GM on \( (a+b), (b+c), (c+d), (d+a) \):

\[
(a+b) \geq 2\sqrt{ab}, \quad (b+c) \geq 2\sqrt{bc}, \quad (c+d) \geq 2\sqrt{cd}, \quad (d+a) \geq 2\sqrt{da}
\]

Thus,

\[
(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a) \geq 16 \sqrt{abcd}
\]

Then,

\[
7(a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+a) \geq 112 \sqrt{abcd}
\]

To satisfy the inequality \( 112 \sqrt{abcd} \geq C abcd \), we can set \( C = 112 \).

### Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all non-negative \( a, b, c, d \) satisfying the given condition is:

\[
\boxed{112}
\]

The answer is \( C=112 \).
