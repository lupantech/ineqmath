    "response": "To solve the problem, we start with the given conditions: \\( x, y, z \\in [-1, 3] \\) and \\( x + y + z = 3 \\). We need to find the smallest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality \n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all \\( x, y, z \\) satisfying these conditions.\n\nFirst, we can use the identity that relates the sum of squares to the square of the sum:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + xz + yz).\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x + y + z = 3 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3^2 - 2(xy + xz + yz) = 9 - 2(xy + xz + yz).\n\\]\n\nTo maximize \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\), we need to minimize \\( xy + xz + yz \\). \n\nNext, we can express \\( z \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\nz = 3 - x - y.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for \\( xy + xz + yz \\):\n\n\\[\nxy + xz + yz = xy + x(3 - x - y) + y(3 - x - y).\n\\]\n\nExpanding this gives:\n\n\\[\nxy + 3x - x^2 - xy + 3y - xy - y^2 = 3x + 3y - x^2 - y^2 - xy.\n\\]\n\nThus, we need to minimize \\( 3(x + y) - (x^2 + y^2 + xy) \\).\n\nNow, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the boundaries of the variables \\( x, y, z \\) to find the maximum of \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the boundaries\n\nThe variables \\( x, y, z \\) can take values in the interval \\([-1, 3]\\). We will check the extreme cases where \\( x, y, z \\) take values at the boundaries of this interval.\n\n1. **Case 1**: \\( x = 3, y = 0, z = 0 \\)\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 9.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Case 2**: \\( x = 0, y = 3, z = 0 \\)\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 0^2 + 3^2 + 0^2 = 9.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Case 3**: \\( x = 0, y = 0, z = 3 \\)\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 0^2 + 0^2 + 3^2 = 9.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Case 4**: \\( x = -1, y = -1, z = 5 \\) (not valid since \\( z \\) exceeds 3).\n\n5. **Case 5**: \\( x = -1, y = 3, z = 1 \\)\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (-1)^2 + 3^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 9 + 1 = 11.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Case 6**: \\( x = 1, y = 1, z = 1 \\)\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Case 7**: \\( x = -1, y = 1, z = 3 \\)\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (-1)^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 1 + 9 = 11.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Conclusion\n\nFrom the cases analyzed, the maximum value of \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\) occurs in cases where one variable is at its maximum (3) and the others are at their minimum (0), yielding a maximum of 9. However, the combination of \\( x = -1, y = 3, z = 1 \\) gives a higher value of 11.\n\nThus, the smallest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality holds for all \\( x, y, z \\) is:\n\n\\[\nC = 11.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is \n\n\\[\n\\text{The answer is } C=11.\n\\]",
