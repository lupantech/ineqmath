## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression \( a^5 + 16b^5 \) under the constraint \( a + b = 1 \) with \( a, b \geq 0 \).

First, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):
\[
b = 1 - a.
\]
Substituting this into the expression gives:
\[
a^5 + 16b^5 = a^5 + 16(1 - a)^5.
\]

Next, we will analyze the function \( f(a) = a^5 + 16(1 - a)^5 \) for \( a \in [0, 1] \).

To find the maximum value of \( f(a) \), we can take the derivative and set it to zero:
\[
f'(a) = 5a^4 - 80(1 - a)^4.
\]
Setting \( f'(a) = 0 \):
\[
5a^4 = 80(1 - a)^4.
\]
Dividing both sides by 5 gives:
\[
a^4 = 16(1 - a)^4.
\]
Taking the fourth root of both sides:
\[
a = 2(1 - a).
\]
Solving for \( a \):
\[
a = 2 - 2a \implies 3a = 2 \implies a = \frac{2}{3}.
\]
Thus, we find \( b \):
\[
b = 1 - a = 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Now we evaluate \( f(a) \) at \( a = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( b = \frac{1}{3} \):
\[
f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5 + 16\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^5.
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5 = \frac{32}{243},
\]
\[
\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^5 = \frac{1}{243} \implies 16\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^5 = \frac{16}{243}.
\]
Thus,
\[
f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{32}{243} + \frac{16}{243} = \frac{48}{243} = \frac{16}{81}.
\]

Next, we need to compare \( \frac{16}{81} \) with \( \frac{1}{6} \):
To do this, we convert \( \frac{1}{6} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 81:
\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{13.5}{81}.
\]
Now we compare:
\[
\frac{16}{81} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{13.5}{81}.
\]
Since \( 16 > 13.5 \), we have:
\[
\frac{16}{81} > \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, we conclude that:
\[
a^5 + 16b^5 > \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:
\[
\boxed{(B) \geq}.
\]

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
