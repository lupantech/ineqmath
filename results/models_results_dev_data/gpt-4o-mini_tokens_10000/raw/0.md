Problem: Let $a, b, c > 0$. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$:

$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given inequality:

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{\sqrt[3]{abc}} + \frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)} \geq C.
\]

We will find the largest constant \( C \) such that this inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \).

### Step 1: Analyze the first term

The first term is 

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{\sqrt[3]{abc}}.
\]

By applying the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \implies a+b+c \geq 3\sqrt[3]{abc}.
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{\sqrt[3]{abc}} \geq 3.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the second term

Next, we consider the second term:

\[
\frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)}.
\]

Using the AM-GM inequality again, we can estimate \( (a+b)(b+c)(c+a) \):

\[
(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) \leq \left(\frac{(a+b) + (b+c) + (c+a)}{3}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{2(a+b+c)}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{8(a+b+c)^3}{27}.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)} \geq \frac{8abc}{\frac{8(a+b+c)^3}{27}} = \frac{27abc}{(a+b+c)^3}.
\]

### Step 3: Combine the terms

Now we combine the two terms:

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{\sqrt[3]{abc}} + \frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)} \geq 3 + \frac{27abc}{(a+b+c)^3}.
\]

### Step 4: Find a lower bound for the second term

To find a lower bound for the entire expression, we need to analyze the term \( \frac{27abc}{(a+b+c)^3} \). 

Using the AM-GM inequality again, we have:

\[
abc \leq \left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right)^3.
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{27abc}{(a+b+c)^3} \leq \frac{27 \left(\frac{(a+b+c)}{3}\right)^3}{(a+b+c)^3} = \frac{27}{27} = 1.
\]

### Step 5: Combine results

Combining our results, we have:

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{\sqrt[3]{abc}} + \frac{8abc}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)} \geq 3 + 1 = 4.
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) is \( C = 4 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=4.
