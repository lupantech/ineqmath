## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality:

\[
a^2 + 4b^2 + 4b + 8c \quad () \quad 7 + 2\sqrt{2(b^2 + c^2)} + 4\sqrt{bc}.
\]

Given that \( a + b + c = 3 \), we can express \( c \) in terms of \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
c = 3 - a - b.
\]

Substituting this into the left-hand side of the inequality, we have:

\[
a^2 + 4b^2 + 4b + 8(3 - a - b) = a^2 + 4b^2 + 4b + 24 - 8a - 8b.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
a^2 + 4b^2 - 8a - 4b + 24.
\]

Now, let's analyze the right-hand side:

\[
7 + 2\sqrt{2(b^2 + c^2)} + 4\sqrt{bc}.
\]

We can express \( c^2 \) as \( (3 - a - b)^2 \):

\[
c^2 = (3 - a - b)^2 = 9 - 6a - 6b + a^2 + 2ab.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
b^2 + c^2 = b^2 + 9 - 6a - 6b + a^2 + 2ab = a^2 + b^2 + 9 - 6a - 5b + 2ab.
\]

Now, we need to compute \( \sqrt{2(b^2 + c^2)} \):

\[
\sqrt{2(b^2 + c^2)} = \sqrt{2(a^2 + b^2 + 9 - 6a - 5b + 2ab)}.
\]

Next, we need to analyze the inequality. To do this, we can test specific values of \( a, b, c \) that satisfy \( a + b + c = 3 \).

Let's try \( a = 1, b = 1, c = 1 \):

Calculating the left-hand side:

\[
1^2 + 4(1^2) + 4(1) + 8(1) = 1 + 4 + 4 + 8 = 17.
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
7 + 2\sqrt{2(1^2 + 1^2)} + 4\sqrt{1 \cdot 1} = 7 + 2\sqrt{4} + 4 = 7 + 4 + 4 = 15.
\]

Now we have:

\[
17 \quad () \quad 15.
\]

This shows that:

\[
17 > 15.
\]

Thus, we can conclude that:

\[
a^2 + 4b^2 + 4b + 8c > 7 + 2\sqrt{2(b^2 + c^2)} + 4\sqrt{bc}.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

\[
\text{The answer is (E) } >.
