Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the constraint given:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 4
\]

We need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the following inequality holds for all non-negative \( a, b, c \):

\[
a + b + c + \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} \leq C
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the constraint

The constraint \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 4 \) suggests that \( a, b, c \) are bounded. We will explore the values of \( a, b, c \) that satisfy this constraint.

### Step 2: Test specific cases

1. **Case 1: \( a = b = c \)**

   Let \( a = b = c = x \). Then the constraint becomes:

   \[
   3x^2 + x^3 = 4
   \]

   Rearranging gives:

   \[
   x^3 + 3x^2 - 4 = 0
   \]

   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 1 \):

   \[
   1^3 + 3(1^2) - 4 = 1 + 3 - 4 = 0
   \]

   Thus, \( x = 1 \) is a root. We can factor the polynomial:

   \[
   (x - 1)(x^2 + 4x + 4) = 0
   \]

   The quadratic \( x^2 + 4x + 4 \) has no real roots (discriminant \( 16 - 16 = 0 \)), so the only non-negative solution is \( x = 1 \).

   Therefore, \( a = b = c = 1 \) is a solution. We compute:

   \[
   a + b + c + \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} = 1 + 1 + 1 + \sqrt{\frac{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}{3}} = 3 + \sqrt{1} = 4
   \]

2. **Case 2: \( a = 2, b = 0, c = 0 \)**

   Check another case where \( a = 2 \), \( b = 0 \), \( c = 0 \):

   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 2^2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4
   \]

   Now compute:

   \[
   a + b + c + \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} = 2 + 0 + 0 + \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}} = 2 + \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = 2 + \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}
   \]

   To find a numerical value, we approximate \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):

   \[
   2 + \frac{2 \cdot 1.732}{3} \approx 2 + 1.155 = 3.155
   \]

3. **Case 3: \( a = 1, b = 1, c = 0 \)**

   Check \( a = 1, b = 1, c = 0 \):

   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 1^2 + 1^2 + 0 + 0 = 2
   \]

   This does not satisfy the constraint.

### Step 3: Conclusion

From the cases we have checked, the maximum value of \( a + b + c + \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} \) occurs at \( a = b = c = 1 \), yielding a total of \( 4 \).

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all non-negative \( a, b, c \) satisfying the constraint is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]

Finally, we state the answer in the required format:

The answer is \( C = 4 \).
