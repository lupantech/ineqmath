## Response

To solve the inequality 

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 2abc + \frac{4a^2b^2c^2}{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + abc} \quad () \quad \sum_{\text{cyc}}(2a^2b + 3a^2c),
\]

we will analyze both sides of the inequality.

### Step 1: Analyze the left-hand side

The left-hand side is 

\[
L = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 2abc + \frac{4a^2b^2c^2}{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + abc}.
\]

Using the identity for the sum of cubes, we have:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) + 3abc.
\]

Thus, we can express \(L\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

### Step 2: Analyze the right-hand side

The right-hand side is 

\[
R = \sum_{\text{cyc}}(2a^2b + 3a^2c) = 2a^2b + 3a^2c + 2b^2c + 3b^2a + 2c^2a + 3c^2b.
\]

### Step 3: Compare both sides

To compare \(L\) and \(R\), we can use specific values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Let's consider the case where \(a = b = c = 1\):

1. **Calculate \(L\)**:
   \[
   L = 1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3 + 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 + \frac{4 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1^2}{1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = 3 + 2 + \frac{4}{4} = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
   \]

2. **Calculate \(R\)**:
   \[
   R = 2 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 1^2 \cdot 1 = 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 15.
   \]

### Step 4: Conclusion from the specific case

From our calculations, we have:

\[
L = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad R = 15.
\]

Thus, we find that 

\[
L < R.
\]

### Step 5: Generalization

To generalize, we can consider the nature of the terms involved. The left-hand side \(L\) includes cubic terms and a fraction that is always positive (since \(ab + ac + bc \neq 0\)), while the right-hand side \(R\) consists of products of squares and linear terms, which tend to grow larger as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) increase.

### Final Answer

Based on our analysis and the specific case, we conclude that the inequality holds as:

\[
L < R.
\]

Thus, the correct relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
