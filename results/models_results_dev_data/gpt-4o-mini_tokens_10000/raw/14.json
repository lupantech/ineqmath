    "response": "To solve the problem, we start with the constraint given:\n\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 4\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the smallest constant \\( C \\) such that the following inequality holds for all non-negative \\( a, b, c \\):\n\n\\[\na + b + c + \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} \\leq C\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the constraint\n\nThe constraint \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 4 \\) suggests that \\( a, b, c \\) are bounded. We will explore the values of \\( a, b, c \\) that satisfy this constraint.\n\n### Step 2: Test specific cases\n\n1. **Case 1: \\( a = b = c \\)**\n\n   Let \\( a = b = c = x \\). Then the constraint becomes:\n\n   \\[\n   3x^2 + x^3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n   Rearranging gives:\n\n   \\[\n   x^3 + 3x^2 - 4 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   1^3 + 3(1^2) - 4 = 1 + 3 - 4 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   Thus, \\( x = 1 \\) is a root. We can factor the polynomial:\n\n   \\[\n   (x - 1)(x^2 + 4x + 4) = 0\n   \\]\n\n   The quadratic \\( x^2 + 4x + 4 \\) has no real roots (discriminant \\( 16 - 16 = 0 \\)), so the only non-negative solution is \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n   Therefore, \\( a = b = c = 1 \\) is a solution. We compute:\n\n   \\[\n   a + b + c + \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} = 1 + 1 + 1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}{3}} = 3 + \\sqrt{1} = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( a = 2, b = 0, c = 0 \\)**\n\n   Check another case where \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = 0 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 2^2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4\n   \\]\n\n   Now compute:\n\n   \\[\n   a + b + c + \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} = 2 + 0 + 0 + \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{3}} = 2 + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} = 2 + \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   To find a numerical value, we approximate \\( \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   2 + \\frac{2 \\cdot 1.732}{3} \\approx 2 + 1.155 = 3.155\n   \\]\n\n3. **Case 3: \\( a = 1, b = 1, c = 0 \\)**\n\n   Check \\( a = 1, b = 1, c = 0 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + abc = 1^2 + 1^2 + 0 + 0 = 2\n   \\]\n\n   This does not satisfy the constraint.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nFrom the cases we have checked, the maximum value of \\( a + b + c + \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}} \\) occurs at \\( a = b = c = 1 \\), yielding a total of \\( 4 \\).\n\nThus, the smallest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality holds for all non-negative \\( a, b, c \\) satisfying the constraint is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we state the answer in the required format:\n\nThe answer is \\( C = 4 \\).",
