    "response": "To solve the problem, we start with the given condition \\( x + y = 2 \\) and we need to find the smallest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality \n\n\\[\nx^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3) \\leq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all positive real numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) satisfying \\( x + y = 2 \\).\n\nFirst, we can express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\ny = 2 - x.\n\\]\n\nNext, we substitute \\( y \\) into the expression \\( x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3) \\):\n\n\\[\ny^3 = (2 - x)^3 = 8 - 12x + 6x^2 - x^3.\n\\]\n\nNow, we compute \\( x^3 + y^3 \\):\n\n\\[\nx^3 + y^3 = x^3 + (2 - x)^3 = x^3 + (8 - 12x + 6x^2 - x^3) = 8 - 12x + 6x^2.\n\\]\n\nThus, we can rewrite the expression we want to analyze:\n\n\\[\nx^3 y^3 = x^3 (2 - x)^3.\n\\]\n\nNow, we can express the entire inequality as:\n\n\\[\nx^3 (2 - x)^3 (8 - 12x + 6x^2) \\leq C.\n\\]\n\nTo find the maximum value of \\( x^3 (2 - x)^3 (8 - 12x + 6x^2) \\), we will analyze the function:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^3 (2 - x)^3 (8 - 12x + 6x^2).\n\\]\n\nWe will find the critical points of \\( f(x) \\) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero.
