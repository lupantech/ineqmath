Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{a^2}{b(m a+n b)}+\frac{b^2}{c(m b+n c)}+\frac{c^2}{a(m c+n a)} \geq \frac{C}{m+n}
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c, m, n \).

### Step 1: Analyze the left-hand side

We start by rewriting the left-hand side of the inequality:

\[
L = \frac{a^2}{b(m a+n b)}+\frac{b^2}{c(m b+n c)}+\frac{c^2}{a(m c+n a)}.
\]

### Step 2: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to each term in \( L \):

\[
\frac{a^2}{b(m a+n b)} \geq \frac{(a^2)^2}{a^2(m a+n b)} = \frac{a^2}{m a + n b}.
\]

Thus, we can rewrite \( L \) as:

\[
L \geq \frac{a^2}{m a + n b} + \frac{b^2}{m b + n c} + \frac{c^2}{m c + n a}.
\]

### Step 3: Use Titu's Lemma

Using Titu's lemma (a form of Cauchy-Schwarz), we can further simplify:

\[
L \geq \frac{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2}{a^2(m a + n b) + b^2(m b + n c) + c^2(m c + n a)}.
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the denominator

Now we need to analyze the denominator:

\[
D = a^2(m a + n b) + b^2(m b + n c) + c^2(m c + n a).
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
D = m(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + n(a^2b + b^2c + c^2a).
\]

### Step 5: Apply AM-GM Inequality

Using the AM-GM inequality, we know that:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \geq 3abc,
\]
and
\[
a^2b + b^2c + c^2a \geq 3\sqrt[3]{(abc)^2}.
\]

### Step 6: Combine results

Thus, we can bound \( D \):

\[
D \geq m \cdot 3abc + n \cdot 3\sqrt[3]{(abc)^2}.
\]

### Step 7: Find the constant \( C \)

To find \( C \), we need to ensure that:

\[
\frac{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2}{D} \geq \frac{C}{m+n}.
\]

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again, we have:

\[
(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 \geq 3abc.
\]

Thus, we can set \( C = 3 \) as a candidate. 

### Step 8: Verify the candidate

To verify if \( C = 3 \) works, we can substitute \( a = b = c = 1 \) and \( m = n = 1 \):

\[
L = \frac{1^2}{1(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1)} + \frac{1^2}{1(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1)} + \frac{1^2}{1(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1)} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}.
\]

And the right-hand side becomes:

\[
\frac{C}{1 + 1} = \frac{C}{2}.
\]

Setting \( C = 3 \):

\[
\frac{3}{2} \geq \frac{3}{2},
\]

which holds true.

### Conclusion

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c, m, n \) is:

\[
\boxed{3}.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is \( C=3 \).
