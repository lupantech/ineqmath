Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the equation given:

\[
(x+1)(y+2) = 8.
\]

We can expand this equation:

\[
xy + 2x + y + 2 = 8.
\]

Rearranging gives us:

\[
xy + 2x + y = 6.
\]

Next, we want to analyze the expression \( |xy - 10| \) and compare it to 7. We can rewrite the expression as:

\[
|xy - 10| = |(xy - 6) - 4|.
\]

This suggests that we need to find bounds for \( xy \) based on the equation we derived. 

To do this, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) using the equation \( (x+1)(y+2) = 8 \):

\[
y + 2 = \frac{8}{x+1} \implies y = \frac{8}{x+1} - 2.
\]

Substituting this into the expression for \( xy \):

\[
xy = x\left(\frac{8}{x+1} - 2\right) = \frac{8x}{x+1} - 2x.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
xy = \frac{8x - 2x(x+1)}{x+1} = \frac{8x - 2x^2 - 2x}{x+1} = \frac{-2x^2 + 6x}{x+1}.
\]

Next, we need to find the maximum and minimum values of \( xy \). To do this, we can analyze the function \( f(x) = -2x^2 + 6x \) and find its critical points by taking the derivative:

\[
f'(x) = -4x + 6.
\]

Setting the derivative to zero gives:

\[
-4x + 6 = 0 \implies x = \frac{3}{2}.
\]

Now we evaluate \( f(x) \) at this critical point:

\[
f\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = -2\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 + 6\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = -2 \cdot \frac{9}{4} + 9 = -\frac{18}{4} + 9 = -\frac{18}{4} + \frac{36}{4} = \frac{18}{4} = \frac{9}{2}.
\]

Next, we need to check the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches the boundaries of its domain. The function \( (x+1)(y+2) = 8 \) implies that \( x \) cannot be equal to -1 (as it would make the denominator zero). 

As \( x \to -1^+ \), \( y \to \infty \) and thus \( xy \to -\infty \). As \( x \to \infty \), \( y \to 0 \) and thus \( xy \to 0 \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( xy \) occurs at \( x = \frac{3}{2} \) and is \( \frac{9}{2} \).

Now we can evaluate \( |xy - 10| \):

1. The maximum value of \( xy \) is \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \).
2. Thus, \( |xy - 10| = |4.5 - 10| = | -5.5 | = 5.5 \).

Now we compare \( 5.5 \) with \( 7 \):

\[
5.5 < 7.
\]

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
|xy - 10| < 7.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
