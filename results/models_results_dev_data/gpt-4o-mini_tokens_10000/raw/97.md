## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} + \frac{1}{c}\) under the constraint \(abc = 1\). 

We can use the method of substitution based on the constraint. Since \(abc = 1\), we can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of a single variable. A common approach is to set \(a = x\), \(b = y\), and \(c = z\) such that \(xyz = 1\). 

Using the method of Lagrange multipliers or the AM-GM inequality, we can analyze the expression. 

### Step 1: Apply the AM-GM Inequality

We can apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms \(\frac{1}{a}\), \(\frac{2}{b}\), and \(\frac{1}{c}\):

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq 4 \sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{2}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{c} \cdot \frac{1}{c}}.
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Expression

Calculating the product inside the root:

\[
\frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{2}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{c} = \frac{2}{abc} = \frac{2}{1} = 2.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq 4 \sqrt[4]{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate \(4 \sqrt[4]{2}\)

Calculating \(4 \sqrt[4]{2}\):

\[
\sqrt[4]{2} = 2^{1/4} \implies 4 \sqrt[4]{2} = 4 \cdot 2^{1/4} = 4 \cdot 2^{0.25} \approx 4 \cdot 1.1892 \approx 4.7568.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with 2

Since \(4 \sqrt[4]{2} > 2\), we conclude that:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq 4 \sqrt[4]{2} > 2.
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, we have shown that:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} + \frac{1}{c} > 2.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (E) $>$.
