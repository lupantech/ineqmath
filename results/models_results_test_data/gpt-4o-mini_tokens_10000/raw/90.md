## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(ab + bc + ca).
\]

This can be rearranged to:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 0.
\]

This expression can be factored as:

\[
\frac{1}{2}((a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2) = 0.
\]

Since the sum of squares is zero, we conclude that:

\[
a = b = c.
\]

Let \( a = b = c = k \) for some non-zero real number \( k \). We can substitute this into the expression we need to evaluate:

\[
(a+b+c)\left(\frac{1}{2a}+\frac{1}{3b}+\frac{1}{c}\right).
\]

Substituting \( a = b = c = k \):

\[
a + b + c = k + k + k = 3k,
\]

and

\[
\frac{1}{2a} + \frac{1}{3b} + \frac{1}{c} = \frac{1}{2k} + \frac{1}{3k} + \frac{1}{k}.
\]

Finding a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{2k} + \frac{1}{3k} + \frac{1}{k} = \frac{3}{6k} + \frac{2}{6k} + \frac{6}{6k} = \frac{3 + 2 + 6}{6k} = \frac{11}{6k}.
\]

Now, we can combine these results:

\[
(3k)\left(\frac{11}{6k}\right) = \frac{33k}{6k} = \frac{33}{6} = 5.5.
\]

Next, we compare this result with 14:

\[
5.5 \quad () \quad 14.
\]

Clearly, \( 5.5 < 14 \). Therefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

\[
5.5 < 14.
\]

Thus, the answer is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
