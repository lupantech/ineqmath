    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality \n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^3}{x-4} \\geq C\n\\]\n\nfor \\( x > 4 \\). We can rearrange this inequality to find a suitable expression for \\( C \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^3}{x-4} - C \\geq 0.\n\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^3 - C(x-4)}{x-4} \\geq 0.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator gives:\n\n\\[\nx^3 - Cx + 4C.\n\\]\n\nThus, we need to find the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the polynomial \n\n\\[\nP(x) = x^3 - Cx + 4C\n\\]\n\nis non-negative for all \\( x > 4 \\). \n\nTo ensure that \\( P(x) \\) is non-negative for \\( x > 4 \\), we can analyze the behavior of \\( P(x) \\) at \\( x = 4 \\) and as \\( x \\to \\infty \\).\n\n1. **Evaluate \\( P(4) \\)**:\n\n\\[\nP(4) = 4^3 - C \\cdot 4 + 4C = 64 - 4C + 4C = 64.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( P(4) = 64 \\), which is positive, we need to ensure that \\( P(x) \\) does not become negative for \\( x > 4 \\).\n\n2. **Analyze the leading term**:\n\nThe leading term of \\( P(x) \\) is \\( x^3 \\), which dominates as \\( x \\to \\infty \\). Therefore, \\( P(x) \\to \\infty \\) as \\( x \\to \\infty \\).\n\n3. **Find critical points**:\n\nTo find the critical points of \\( P(x) \\), we take the derivative:\n\n\\[\nP'(x) = 3x^2 - C.\n\\]\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero gives:\n\n\\[\n3x^2 - C = 0 \\implies x^2 = \\frac{C}{3} \\implies x = \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{3}}.\n\\]\n\nFor \\( x > 4 \\), we require \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{3}} > 4 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{3} > 16 \\implies C > 48.\n\\]\n\n4. **Behavior of \\( P(x) \\)**:\n\nNext, we need to ensure that \\( P(x) \\) is non-negative for \\( x > 4 \\). Since \\( P(4) = 64 > 0 \\) and \\( P(x) \\to \\infty \\) as \\( x \\to \\infty \\), we need to check the minimum value of \\( P(x) \\) for \\( x \\geq 4 \\).\n\n5. **Minimum value of \\( P(x) \\)**:\n\nTo find the minimum value of \\( P(x) \\) for \\( x > 4 \\), we evaluate \\( P(x) \\) at the critical point \\( x = \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{3}} \\). We need \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{3}} \\) to be greater than 4, which gives us the condition \\( C > 48 \\).\n\n6. **Finding the largest \\( C \\)**:\n\nTo find the largest \\( C \\) such that \\( P(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x > 4 \\), we can set \\( C = 48 \\) and check if \\( P(x) \\) is non-negative:\n\n\\[\nP(x) = x^3 - 48x + 192.\n\\]\n\nWe can check the behavior of \\( P(x) \\) at \\( x = 4 \\):\n\n\\[\nP(4) = 64 - 192 + 192 = 64 > 0.\n\\]\n\nAs \\( x \\to \\infty \\), \\( P(x) \\to \\infty \\). Thus, \\( P(x) \\) is non-negative for \\( x > 4 \\).\n\nTherefore, the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality holds for all \\( x > 4 \\) is \n\n\\[\nC = 48.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The answer is } C=48.\n\\]",
