## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given conditions:

1. The sum of the numbers is zero:
   \[
   a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n = 0
   \]

2. The maximum difference between any two numbers is at most 1:
   \[
   \max \{|a_i - a_j| \mid 1 \leq i, j \leq n\} \leq 1
   \]

From the second condition, we can infer that all the \(a_i\) values lie within a range of 1 unit. Specifically, if we denote the minimum value among \(a_i\) as \(m\) and the maximum value as \(M\), we have:
\[
M - m \leq 1
\]
This implies:
\[
m \leq a_i \leq m + 1 \quad \text{for all } i
\]

Since the sum of the \(a_i\) is zero, we can express the \(a_i\) values in terms of their average. The average of the \(a_i\) values is:
\[
\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n}{n} = 0
\]
This means that the values \(a_i\) are distributed around zero.

Next, we can express \(a_i\) in terms of a central value \(c\) (which is the average, here \(c = 0\)) and some deviations \(d_i\):
\[
a_i = d_i \quad \text{where } d_i \text{ are deviations from the average}
\]
Given the maximum difference condition, we can say:
\[
-0.5 \leq d_i \leq 0.5
\]
for all \(i\) (since the total must sum to zero, the deviations must balance out).

Now, we compute the sum of squares:
\[
a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 = d_1^2 + d_2^2 + \ldots + d_n^2
\]

To find a bound for this sum, we note that each \(d_i^2\) is maximized when \(d_i\) is at its extreme values of \(-0.5\) or \(0.5\):
\[
d_i^2 \leq \left(0.5\right)^2 = 0.25
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
d_1^2 + d_2^2 + \ldots + d_n^2 \leq n \cdot 0.25 = \frac{n}{4}
\]

Next, we need to compare this with the expression on the right side of the inequality:
\[
\frac{1}{n}\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right]
\]

Calculating this expression:
- The term \(\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{n}{2}\).
- The term \(\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{n+1}{2}\).

For even \(n\):
\[
\left[\frac{n}{2}\right] = \frac{n}{2}, \quad \left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right] = \frac{n}{2}
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{1}{n}\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right] = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{n}{2} \cdot \frac{n}{2} = \frac{n}{4}
\]

For odd \(n\):
\[
\left[\frac{n}{2}\right] = \frac{n-1}{2}, \quad \left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right] = \frac{n+1}{2}
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{1}{n}\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right] = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{n-1}{2} \cdot \frac{n+1}{2} = \frac{(n^2 - 1)}{4n}
\]

In both cases, we find that:
\[
a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 \leq \frac{n}{4}
\]
and
\[
\frac{1}{n}\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right] \geq \frac{n}{4}
\]

Thus, we conclude:
\[
a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots + a_n^2 \leq \frac{1}{n}\left[\frac{n}{2}\right]\left[\frac{n+1}{2}\right]
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:
\[
\text{The answer is (A) } \leq
\]
