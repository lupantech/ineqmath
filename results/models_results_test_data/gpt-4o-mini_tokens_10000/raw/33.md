## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition that \( abc = 1 \) for positive real numbers \( a, b, c \). We need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( abc = 1 \).

First, we can rewrite the left-hand side of the inequality using the condition \( abc = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} = \frac{bc + ac + ab}{abc} = bc + ac + ab.
\]

Next, we apply the AM-GM inequality, which states that for any non-negative real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \):

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \ldots x_n}.
\]

In our case, we can apply AM-GM to the terms \( \frac{1}{a}, \frac{1}{b}, \frac{1}{c} \):

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{abc}}.
\]

Since \( abc = 1 \), we have:

\[
\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{abc}} = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1.
\]

Thus, we can conclude:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq 3.
\]

This shows that \( C \) can be at least 3. To check if \( C = 3 \) is indeed the largest constant, we need to verify if the equality can be achieved.

The equality in the AM-GM inequality holds when all the terms are equal, i.e., when \( \frac{1}{a} = \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{c} \). This occurs when \( a = b = c \). Given \( abc = 1 \), we can set \( a = b = c = 1 \). In this case:

\[
\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} = 3.
\]

Thus, the inequality holds with equality when \( a = b = c = 1 \).

Since we have shown that \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq 3 \) for all positive \( a, b, c \) such that \( abc = 1 \), and that this bound is achievable, we conclude that the largest constant \( C \) satisfying the inequality is:

\[
C = 3.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

The answer is \( C=3 \).
