Problem: Let $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4$. Find the minimal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \leq C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To find the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \leq C
\]

holds for all \( a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R} \) satisfying the constraint 

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4,
\]

we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

### Step 1: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)(a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4) \geq (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3)^2.
\]

Given that \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \), we can substitute this into the inequality:

\[
4(a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4) \geq (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3)^2.
\]

### Step 2: Find Maximum of \( a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 \)

To find the maximum of \( a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 \) under the constraint \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \), we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or consider the case where one variable is maximized while the others are minimized.

Assume \( a = 2 \) and \( b = c = d = 0 \). Then:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 2^2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4,
\]

and 

\[
a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 = 2^4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 16.
\]

Now, substituting this back into our earlier inequality:

\[
4 \cdot 16 \geq (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3)^2.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
64 \geq (2^3 + 0 + 0 + 0)^2 = 8^2 = 64.
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion

The equality holds when \( a = 2 \) and \( b = c = d = 0 \). Thus, we have:

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 = 8.
\]

Therefore, the maximum value of \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + d^3 \) under the given constraint is \( 8 \). Hence, the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a, b, c, d \) satisfying the constraint is:

\[
C = 8.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=8.
\]
