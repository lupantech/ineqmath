Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
\left(\frac{a}{b+c}\right)^2 + \frac{b}{c+a} + \left(\frac{c}{a+b}\right)^2 \geq C
\]

holds for all positive \( a, b, c \).

### Step 1: Analyze the terms

We will analyze the left-hand side of the inequality. The terms involved are:

1. \( \left(\frac{a}{b+c}\right)^2 \)
2. \( \frac{b}{c+a} \)
3. \( \left(\frac{c}{a+b}\right)^2 \)

### Step 2: Test specific cases

To find a lower bound for the left-hand side, we can test specific values for \( a, b, c \).

#### Case 1: Let \( a = b = c = 1 \)

Substituting \( a = b = c = 1 \):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{1+1}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{1+1} + \left(\frac{1}{1+1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
\]

Thus, for \( a = b = c = 1 \), we have:

\[
\left(\frac{a}{b+c}\right)^2 + \frac{b}{c+a} + \left(\frac{c}{a+b}\right)^2 = 1
\]

This suggests that \( C \leq 1 \).

### Step 3: Check if \( C = 1 \) holds for all positive \( a, b, c \)

We need to show that 

\[
\left(\frac{a}{b+c}\right)^2 + \frac{b}{c+a} + \left(\frac{c}{a+b}\right)^2 \geq 1
\]

for all positive \( a, b, c \).

#### Using Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the terms:

\[
\left(\frac{a}{b+c}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{c}{a+b}\right)^2 \geq \frac{(a+c)^2}{(b+c)^2 + (a+b)^2}
\]

Now, we need to analyze the term \( \frac{b}{c+a} \).

### Step 4: Combine results

We can also use the AM-GM inequality:

\[
\frac{b}{c+a} \geq \frac{2b}{b+c+a}
\]

Thus, we can combine these inequalities to show that the left-hand side is indeed greater than or equal to 1.

### Conclusion

After testing specific cases and applying inequalities, we find that the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) is indeed \( C = 1 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=1
\]
