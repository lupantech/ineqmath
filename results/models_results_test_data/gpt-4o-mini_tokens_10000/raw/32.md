Problem: Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(x+1)(y+2) = 8$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x, y$ satisfying the given constraint:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the constraint given by the equation:

\[
(x+1)(y+2) = 8.
\]

We can expand this equation:

\[
xy + 2x + y + 2 = 8 \implies xy + 2x + y = 6.
\]

We want to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality 

\[
|xy - 10| \geq C
\]

holds for all \( x, y \) satisfying the constraint. This can be rewritten as:

\[
xy - 10 \leq -C \quad \text{or} \quad xy - 10 \geq C.
\]

This implies:

\[
xy \leq 10 - C \quad \text{or} \quad xy \geq 10 + C.
\]

To analyze the values of \( xy \), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) using the constraint:

\[
y = \frac{6 - 2x}{x + 1}.
\]

Substituting this into \( xy \):

\[
xy = x \cdot \frac{6 - 2x}{x + 1} = \frac{6x - 2x^2}{x + 1}.
\]

Next, we need to find the maximum and minimum values of \( xy \) as \( x \) varies. We can denote:

\[
f(x) = \frac{6x - 2x^2}{x + 1}.
\]

To find the critical points, we differentiate \( f(x) \):

Using the quotient rule:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{(6 - 4x)(x + 1) - (6x - 2x^2)(1)}{(x + 1)^2}.
\]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[
(6 - 4x)(x + 1) - (6x - 2x^2) = 6x + 6 - 4x^2 - 4x - 6x + 2x^2 = -2x^2 + 6.
\]

Setting the numerator equal to zero to find critical points:

\[
-2x^2 + 6 = 0 \implies 2x^2 = 6 \implies x^2 = 3 \implies x = \sqrt{3} \text{ or } x = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

Next, we evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points and also check the behavior as \( x \to -1 \) (the point where the function is undefined) and as \( x \to \infty \) or \( x \to -\infty \).

1. **At \( x = \sqrt{3} \)**:

\[
y = \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} + 1},
\]
\[
xy = \sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} + 1}.
\]

2. **At \( x = -\sqrt{3} \)**:

\[
y = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{3}}{-\sqrt{3} + 1},
\]
\[
xy = -\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{3}}{-\sqrt{3} + 1}.
\]

3. **As \( x \to -1 \)**, we find \( y \to 4 \) and \( xy \to -4 \).

4. **As \( x \to \infty \)**, \( xy \to -\infty \).

Now we need to find the maximum and minimum values of \( xy \) from the evaluations. 

After evaluating the critical points and limits, we find:

- The maximum value of \( xy \) occurs at \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 0 \), giving \( xy = 0 \).
- The minimum value occurs at \( x = -1 \) and \( y = 4 \), giving \( xy = -4 \).

Thus, the range of \( xy \) is from \( -4 \) to \( 0 \). 

Now we can find \( C \):

\[
|xy - 10| \geq C \implies |xy - 10| \text{ ranges from } |0 - 10| = 10 \text{ to } |-4 - 10| = 14.
\]

The minimum value of \( |xy - 10| \) is \( 10 \), so the largest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all \( x, y \) is:

\[
C = 10.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=10.
\]
