## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given equation:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + 3 = 4ab.
\]

We can rearrange this equation to isolate the terms involving \(a\) and \(b\):

\[
a^2 + b^2 - 4ab + 3 = 0.
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
(a - b)^2 + 3 = 4ab.
\]

Next, we can express \(ab\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). From the equation \(a^2 + b^2 + 3 = 4ab\), we can also express \(ab\) as:

\[
ab = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + 3}{4}.
\]

Now, we need to analyze the inequality:

\[
2\sqrt{2ab} - \frac{1}{2}a - b \quad () \quad \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Substituting \(ab\) into the inequality, we have:

\[
2\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{a^2 + b^2 + 3}{4}} - \frac{1}{2}a - b.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2\sqrt{\frac{2(a^2 + b^2 + 3)}{4}} - \frac{1}{2}a - b = 2\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + 3}{2}} - \frac{1}{2}a - b.
\]

Next, we will analyze the expression \(2\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + 3}{2}}\). We know from the rearranged equation that \(a^2 + b^2 = 4ab - 3\). Thus, we can substitute this into our expression:

\[
2\sqrt{\frac{4ab - 3 + 3}{2}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{4ab}{2}} = 2\sqrt{2ab}.
\]

Now we need to compare \(2\sqrt{2ab} - \frac{1}{2}a - b\) with \(\frac{1}{2}\).

To analyze this, we can consider specific values for \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy the original equation. Let's try \(a = b\):

If \(a = b\), then substituting into the original equation gives:

\[
2a^2 + 3 = 4a^2 \implies 3 = 2a^2 \implies a^2 = \frac{3}{2} \implies a = b = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}.
\]

Now substituting \(a = b = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\) into the inequality:

\[
2\sqrt{2ab} = 2\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{2}} = 2\sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}a + b = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} + \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{6}}{4}.
\]

Now we need to compare \(2\sqrt{3}\) with \(\frac{3\sqrt{6}}{4}\):

Calculating \(2\sqrt{3}\):

\[
2\sqrt{3} = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{4}.
\]

Now we compare:

\[
\frac{8\sqrt{3}}{4} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3\sqrt{6}}{4}.
\]

This simplifies to comparing \(8\sqrt{3}\) and \(3\sqrt{6}\). Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots gives:

\[
64 \cdot 3 = 192 \quad \text{and} \quad 9 \cdot 6 = 54.
\]

Since \(192 > 54\), we have:

\[
2\sqrt{2ab} > \frac{1}{2}a + b.
\]

Thus, we conclude:

\[
2\sqrt{2ab} - \frac{1}{2}a - b > \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (E) $>$.
