    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression \\( x(x-y)(z-x) \\) for \\( x, y, z \\in [0, 1] \\) and find the minimal constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality holds for all possible values of \\( x, y, z \\) in that range.\n\n1. **Understanding the Expression**:\n   The expression \\( x(x-y)(z-x) \\) can be broken down as follows:\n   - \\( x \\) is a factor that scales the entire expression and is bounded between 0 and 1.\n   - \\( (x-y) \\) can be positive or negative depending on the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n   - \\( (z-x) \\) can also be positive or negative depending on the values of \\( z \\) and \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Finding Critical Points**:\n   We will analyze the expression by considering the boundaries of the variables \\( x, y, z \\) in the interval \\([0, 1]\\).\n\n   - **Case 1**: Let \\( x = 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     0(0-y)(z-0) = 0.\n     \\]\n\n   - **Case 2**: Let \\( x = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     1(1-y)(z-1) = (1-y)(z-1).\n     \\]\n     Here, \\( (1-y) \\) is non-negative when \\( y \\leq 1 \\) and \\( (z-1) \\) is non-positive when \\( z \\leq 1 \\). Thus, this expression is non-positive and does not exceed 0.\n\n   - **Case 3**: Let \\( y = 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     x(x-0)(z-x) = x^2(z-x).\n     \\]\n     This expression is non-negative for \\( x \\in [0, 1] \\) and \\( z \\in [0, 1] \\).\n\n   - **Case 4**: Let \\( z = 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     x(x-y)(0-x) = -x^2(x-y).\n     \\]\n     This expression is non-positive when \\( x \\geq y \\) and non-negative when \\( x < y \\).\n\n3. **Maximizing the Expression**:\n   To find the maximum value of \\( x(x-y)(z-x) \\), we can consider specific values of \\( x, y, z \\):\n   - Let \\( x = 1 \\), \\( y = 0 \\), and \\( z = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     1(1-0)(1-1) = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0 = 0.\n     \\]\n   - Let \\( x = 1 \\), \\( y = 1 \\), and \\( z = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     1(1-1)(1-1) = 0.\n     \\]\n   - Let \\( x = 0.5 \\), \\( y = 0 \\), and \\( z = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     0.5(0.5-0)(1-0.5) = 0.5 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot 0.5 = 0.125.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Finding the Maximum Value**:\n   We can also check the case where \\( x = 0.5 \\), \\( y = 0.5 \\), and \\( z = 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   0.5(0.5-0.5)(1-0.5) = 0.5 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 0.5 = 0.\n   \\]\n   The maximum value we have found so far is \\( 0.125 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   After checking various combinations of \\( x, y, z \\) in the interval \\([0, 1]\\), we find that the maximum value of \\( x(x-y)(z-x) \\) does not exceed \\( 0.125 \\). Therefore, the minimal constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality holds for all \\( x, y, z \\in [0, 1] \\) is \\( 0.125 \\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\( C = 0.125 \\).\n\nThe answer is \\( C = 0.125 \\).",
