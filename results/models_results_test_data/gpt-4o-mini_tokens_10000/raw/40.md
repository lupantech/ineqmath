## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality 

\[
\frac{a+1}{a+b+1}+\frac{b+1}{b+c+1}+\frac{c+1}{c+a+1} \geq C
\]

for non-negative \(a, b, c\) such that \(a + b + c = 3\). We aim to find the largest constant \(C\) for which this inequality holds for all valid values of \(a, b, c\).

### Step 1: Simplifying the Expression

We can rewrite each term in the sum:

\[
\frac{a+1}{a+b+1} = 1 - \frac{b}{a+b+1}
\]

Thus, we can express the entire sum as:

\[
\frac{a+1}{a+b+1} + \frac{b+1}{b+c+1} + \frac{c+1}{c+a+1} = 3 - \left( \frac{b}{a+b+1} + \frac{c}{b+c+1} + \frac{a}{c+a+1} \right)
\]

### Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound

To find a lower bound for the sum, we need to analyze the term 

\[
\frac{b}{a+b+1} + \frac{c}{b+c+1} + \frac{a}{c+a+1}.
\]

### Step 3: Testing Specific Cases

Let's test some specific cases to find a potential lower bound for the left-hand side.

1. **Case 1: \(a = 3, b = 0, c = 0\)**

\[
\frac{3+1}{3+0+1} + \frac{0+1}{0+0+1} + \frac{0+1}{0+3+1} = \frac{4}{4} + 1 + \frac{1}{4} = 1 + 1 + 0.25 = 2.25.
\]

2. **Case 2: \(a = 1, b = 1, c = 1\)**

\[
\frac{1+1}{1+1+1} + \frac{1+1}{1+1+1} + \frac{1+1}{1+1+1} = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = 2.
\]

3. **Case 3: \(a = 2, b = 1, c = 0\)**

\[
\frac{2+1}{2+1+1} + \frac{1+1}{1+0+1} + \frac{0+1}{0+2+1} = \frac{3}{4} + 1 + \frac{1}{3} = 0.75 + 1 + 0.3333 \approx 2.0833.
\]

### Step 4: Analyzing the Results

From the cases tested, we observe that the minimum value of the left-hand side occurs in Case 2, yielding a value of 2. 

### Step 5: Conclusion

Since we have found that the expression achieves a minimum value of 2, we can conclude that the largest constant \(C\) such that the inequality holds for all non-negative \(a, b, c\) with \(a + b + c = 3\) is:

\[
C = 2.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=2.
