## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the expression 

\[
S = \frac{1}{x+x^3} + \frac{1}{y+y^3} + \frac{1}{z+z^3}
\]

given the constraint \( xy + yz + zx = 1 \) for positive real numbers \( x, y, z > 0 \).

### Step 1: Simplifying the terms

We can rewrite each term in \( S \):

\[
\frac{1}{x+x^3} = \frac{1}{x(1+x^2)}.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
S = \frac{1}{x(1+x^2)} + \frac{1}{y(1+y^2)} + \frac{1}{z(1+z^2)}.
\]

### Step 2: Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the terms in \( S \):

\[
\left( \frac{1}{x(1+x^2)} + \frac{1}{y(1+y^2)} + \frac{1}{z(1+z^2)} \right) \left( (1+x^2) + (1+y^2) + (1+z^2) \right) \geq (1+1+1)^2 = 9.
\]

This gives us:

\[
S \cdot (3 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \geq 9.
\]

### Step 3: Finding a bound for \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \)

Using the identity \( (x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx) \), we can express \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \):

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Since \( xy + yz + zx = 1 \), we have:

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2.
\]

### Step 4: Using the AM-GM Inequality

By the AM-GM inequality, we know:

\[
\frac{x+y+z}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz}.
\]

Let \( t = x+y+z \). Then, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( t \):

\[
S \cdot (3 + (t^2 - 2)) \geq 9 \implies S \cdot (t^2 + 1) \geq 9.
\]

### Step 5: Finding a maximum for \( S \)

To find a maximum for \( S \), we can consider the case when \( x = y = z \). Let \( x = y = z = k \). Then:

\[
3k^2 = 1 \implies k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

Substituting \( k \) into \( S \):

\[
S = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{k(1+k^2)} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left(1 + \frac{1}{3}\right)} = 3 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\frac{4}{3}} = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{4}.
\]

### Step 6: Comparing \( S \) with \( \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{4} \)

Now we need to compare \( \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{4} \) with \( \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{4} \):

\[
\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{4} > \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{4} \implies \sqrt{3} > \sqrt{2}.
\]

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
S > \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{4}.
\]

### Conclusion

Therefore, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

\[
\frac{1}{x+x^3} + \frac{1}{y+y^3} + \frac{1}{z+z^3} > \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{4}.
\]

Thus, the answer is:

The answer is (E) $>$.
