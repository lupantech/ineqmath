## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition:

\[
a + b + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 10.
\]

We need to analyze the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b}.
\]

To find a relationship between \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b}\) and 1, we will manipulate the inequality condition.

### Step 1: Analyze the condition

We can rewrite the condition \(a + b + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq 10\) in a more manageable form. Notice that:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \geq \frac{a + b}{\sqrt{2}} \quad \text{(by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality)}.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
a + b + \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \geq a + b + \frac{a + b}{\sqrt{2}} = (1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})(a + b).
\]

This implies:

\[
(1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})(a + b) \leq 10.
\]

Let \(s = a + b\). Then:

\[
s \leq \frac{10}{1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} + 1}.
\]

### Step 2: Find bounds for \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b}\)

Using the method of Lagrange multipliers or the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we can analyze \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b}\):

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \geq \frac{(1 + 2)^2}{a + 2b} = \frac{9}{a + 2b}.
\]

Now, we need to relate \(a + 2b\) to \(s\). Since \(b \leq s\), we can write:

\[
a + 2b \geq a + b = s.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \geq \frac{9}{s}.
\]

### Step 3: Find the maximum of \(s\)

From our earlier analysis, we have:

\[
s \leq \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} + 1}.
\]

Calculating this value:

\[
\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \implies \sqrt{2} + 1 \approx 2.414 \implies \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} + 1} \approx \frac{10 \times 1.414}{2.414} \approx 5.85.
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate \(\frac{9}{s}\)

Now, substituting the maximum value of \(s\):

\[
\frac{9}{s} \geq \frac{9}{5.85} \approx 1.54.
\]

This shows that:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \geq 1.54 > 1.
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} > 1.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality to fill in the blank is:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{2}{b} \quad > \quad 1.
\]

The answer is (E) $>$.
