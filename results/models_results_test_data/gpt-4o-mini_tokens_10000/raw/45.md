Problem: Let $x > 4$. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x$:

$$
\frac{x^3}{x-4} \geq C.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality 

\[
\frac{x^3}{x-4} \geq C
\]

for \( x > 4 \). We can rearrange this inequality to find a suitable expression for \( C \):

\[
\frac{x^3}{x-4} - C \geq 0.
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{x^3 - C(x-4)}{x-4} \geq 0.
\]

Simplifying the numerator gives:

\[
x^3 - Cx + 4C.
\]

Thus, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the polynomial 

\[
P(x) = x^3 - Cx + 4C
\]

is non-negative for all \( x > 4 \). 

To ensure that \( P(x) \) is non-negative for \( x > 4 \), we can analyze the behavior of \( P(x) \) at \( x = 4 \) and as \( x \to \infty \).

1. **Evaluate \( P(4) \)**:

\[
P(4) = 4^3 - C \cdot 4 + 4C = 64 - 4C + 4C = 64.
\]

Since \( P(4) = 64 \), which is positive, we need to ensure that \( P(x) \) does not become negative for \( x > 4 \).

2. **Analyze the leading term**:

The leading term of \( P(x) \) is \( x^3 \), which dominates as \( x \to \infty \). Therefore, \( P(x) \to \infty \) as \( x \to \infty \).

3. **Find critical points**:

To find the critical points of \( P(x) \), we take the derivative:

\[
P'(x) = 3x^2 - C.
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:

\[
3x^2 - C = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{C}{3} \implies x = \sqrt{\frac{C}{3}}.
\]

For \( x > 4 \), we require \( \sqrt{\frac{C}{3}} > 4 \):

\[
\frac{C}{3} > 16 \implies C > 48.
\]

4. **Behavior of \( P(x) \)**:

Next, we need to ensure that \( P(x) \) is non-negative for \( x > 4 \). Since \( P(4) = 64 > 0 \) and \( P(x) \to \infty \) as \( x \to \infty \), we need to check the minimum value of \( P(x) \) for \( x \geq 4 \).

5. **Minimum value of \( P(x) \)**:

To find the minimum value of \( P(x) \) for \( x > 4 \), we evaluate \( P(x) \) at the critical point \( x = \sqrt{\frac{C}{3}} \). We need \( \sqrt{\frac{C}{3}} \) to be greater than 4, which gives us the condition \( C > 48 \).

6. **Finding the largest \( C \)**:

To find the largest \( C \) such that \( P(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x > 4 \), we can set \( C = 48 \) and check if \( P(x) \) is non-negative:

\[
P(x) = x^3 - 48x + 192.
\]

We can check the behavior of \( P(x) \) at \( x = 4 \):

\[
P(4) = 64 - 192 + 192 = 64 > 0.
\]

As \( x \to \infty \), \( P(x) \to \infty \). Thus, \( P(x) \) is non-negative for \( x > 4 \).

Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( x > 4 \) is 

\[
C = 48.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=48.
