## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given inequality:

\[
\sum_{\text{cyc}}\left(\frac{1}{1+a}+\frac{1}{1+bc}\right) \geq C\left(\frac{1}{1+k}+\frac{1}{1+k^2}\right).
\]

We will first simplify the left-hand side of the inequality. The cyclic sum can be expanded as follows:

\[
\sum_{\text{cyc}} \left(\frac{1}{1+a} + \frac{1}{1+bc}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{1+a} + \frac{1}{1+b} + \frac{1}{1+c}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{1+bc} + \frac{1}{1+ca} + \frac{1}{1+ab}\right).
\]

Next, we will analyze the right-hand side. We need to find the values of \( k \) and the corresponding expressions for \( \frac{1}{1+k} \) and \( \frac{1}{1+k^2} \).

Given that \( abc = k^3 \), we can use the AM-GM inequality to relate \( a, b, c \) to \( k \). Since \( a, b, c > 0 \), we can assume \( a = kx, b = ky, c = kz \) where \( xyz = 1 \) (this is valid since \( abc = k^3 \)).

Now, we can rewrite the left-hand side:

1. **First part**: 

\[
\frac{1}{1+a} + \frac{1}{1+b} + \frac{1}{1+c} = \frac{1}{1+kx} + \frac{1}{1+ky} + \frac{1}{1+kz}.
\]

2. **Second part**:

\[
\frac{1}{1+bc} + \frac{1}{1+ca} + \frac{1}{1+ab} = \frac{1}{1+k^2xy} + \frac{1}{1+k^2yz} + \frac{1}{1+k^2zx}.
\]

Next, we will analyze the behavior of these fractions as \( k \) varies. 

To find the largest constant \( C \), we can test specific values of \( a, b, c \) that satisfy \( abc = k^3 \). A natural choice is to set \( a = b = c = k \). In this case:

\[
\sum_{\text{cyc}} \left(\frac{1}{1+k} + \frac{1}{1+k^2}\right) = 3\left(\frac{1}{1+k} + \frac{1}{1+k^2}\right).
\]

Now, substituting \( a = b = c = k \) into the left-hand side gives:

\[
3\left(\frac{1}{1+k} + \frac{1}{1+k^2}\right).
\]

For the right-hand side, we have:

\[
C\left(\frac{1}{1+k} + \frac{1}{1+k^2}\right).
\]

Setting these equal gives:

\[
3\left(\frac{1}{1+k} + \frac{1}{1+k^2}\right) \geq C\left(\frac{1}{1+k} + \frac{1}{1+k^2}\right).
\]

Dividing both sides by \( \frac{1}{1+k} + \frac{1}{1+k^2} \) (which is positive for \( k > 1 \)) leads to:

\[
3 \geq C.
\]

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all \( a, b, c > 0 \) with \( abc = k^3 \) is \( C = 3 \).

Therefore, the answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=3.
