## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given condition:

\[
x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 = \frac{2}{5} a^2
\]

We need to analyze the expression \( |x - y + z| \) and compare it to \( a \).

### Step 1: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to relate the terms \( x, y, z \) to \( a \). The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers \( u_1, u_2, u_3 \) and \( v_1, v_2, v_3 \):

\[
(u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2)(v_1^2 + v_2^2 + v_3^2) \geq (u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + u_3 v_3)^2
\]

We can choose \( u_1 = x \), \( u_2 = -y \), \( u_3 = z \) and \( v_1 = 1 \), \( v_2 = 1 \), \( v_3 = 1 \). Then we have:

\[
(x^2 + (-y)^2 + z^2)(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) \geq (x - y + z)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)(3) \geq (x - y + z)^2
\]

### Step 2: Relate \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) to \( a^2 \)

From the original equation, we can express \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) in terms of \( a^2 \):

\[
x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 = \frac{2}{5} a^2
\]

We can rewrite \( 2y^2 \) as \( y^2 + y^2 \) to help us relate it to \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \):

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 = \frac{2}{5} a^2
\]

Thus, we can say:

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \leq \frac{2}{5} a^2
\]

### Step 3: Substitute into the Cauchy-Schwarz Result

Now substituting back into our Cauchy-Schwarz result:

\[
3(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \leq 3 \cdot \frac{2}{5} a^2 = \frac{6}{5} a^2
\]

This gives us:

\[
(x - y + z)^2 \leq \frac{6}{5} a^2
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[
|x - y + z| \leq \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} a
\]

### Step 4: Compare \( |x - y + z| \) with \( a \)

Now we need to determine the relationship between \( |x - y + z| \) and \( a \). Since \( \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} \) is greater than \( 1 \) (approximately \( 1.095 \)), we have:

\[
|x - y + z| \leq \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} a
\]

This means that \( |x - y + z| \) can be less than or equal to \( a \), but it can also exceed \( a \) depending on the values of \( x, y, z \).

### Conclusion

Since we have established that \( |x - y + z| \) can be less than or equal to \( a \), the most appropriate inequality to fill in the blank is:

\[
|x - y + z| \leq a
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

The answer is (A) $\leq$.
