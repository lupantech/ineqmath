Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the given inequality:

\[
\frac{a^n - 1}{n} \geq C\sqrt{a}^{n+1} - \sqrt{a}^{n-1}.
\]

We can rewrite the right-hand side:

\[
C\sqrt{a}^{n+1} - \sqrt{a}^{n-1} = C a^{(n+1)/2} - a^{(n-1)/2}.
\]

Now, we can express the left-hand side in a more manageable form. As \( n \) becomes large, we can analyze the asymptotic behavior of both sides of the inequality.

### Step 1: Analyze the left-hand side

For large \( n \):

\[
\frac{a^n - 1}{n} \sim \frac{a^n}{n} \quad \text{(since \( a^n \) dominates -1 for large \( n \))}.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the right-hand side

For large \( n \):

\[
C a^{(n+1)/2} - a^{(n-1)/2} \sim C a^{(n+1)/2} \quad \text{(since \( C a^{(n+1)/2} \) dominates \( a^{(n-1)/2} \) for large \( n \))}.
\]

### Step 3: Set up the asymptotic inequality

We want to find \( C \) such that:

\[
\frac{a^n}{n} \geq C a^{(n+1)/2}.
\]

Dividing both sides by \( a^{(n+1)/2} \):

\[
\frac{a^n}{n a^{(n+1)/2}} \geq C.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{a^{n/2 - 1/2}}{n} \geq C.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the limit as \( n \to \infty \)

As \( n \to \infty \), the left-hand side behaves like:

\[
\frac{a^{n/2 - 1/2}}{n} \to \infty \quad \text{(since \( a > 1 \))}.
\]

This means that for sufficiently large \( n \), the left-hand side can be made arbitrarily large, which suggests that \( C \) can be chosen to be as large as possible.

### Step 5: Find the largest constant \( C \)

To find the largest constant \( C \), we need to ensure that the inequality holds for all \( n \). We can analyze the case when \( n \) is small, particularly \( n = 1 \):

\[
\frac{a^1 - 1}{1} \geq C a^{3/2} - a^{1/2}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
a - 1 \geq C a^{3/2} - a^{1/2}.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
a - 1 + a^{1/2} \geq C a^{3/2}.
\]

To find \( C \), we can set \( n = 1 \):

\[
C \leq \frac{a - 1 + a^{1/2}}{a^{3/2}}.
\]

### Step 6: Find the limit of \( C \)

As \( a \to 1 \):

\[
C \leq \frac{1 - 1 + 1}{1} = 1.
\]

As \( a \to \infty \):

\[
C \leq \frac{a}{a^{3/2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \to 0.
\]

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all \( n \) is:

\[
C = 1.
\]

### Conclusion

The largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( n \in \mathbb{N} \) is:

\[
\boxed{1}.
\]

Thus, we state the final answer as:

The answer is \( C=1 \).
