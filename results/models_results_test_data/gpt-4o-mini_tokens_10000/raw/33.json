    "response": "To solve the problem, we start with the given condition that \\( abc = 1 \\) for positive real numbers \\( a, b, c \\). We need to find the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} \\geq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all positive \\( a, b, c \\) satisfying \\( abc = 1 \\).\n\nFirst, we can rewrite the left-hand side of the inequality using the condition \\( abc = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} = \\frac{bc + ac + ab}{abc} = bc + ac + ab.\n\\]\n\nNext, we apply the AM-GM inequality, which states that for any non-negative real numbers \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_n}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \\ldots x_n}.\n\\]\n\nIn our case, we can apply AM-GM to the terms \\( \\frac{1}{a}, \\frac{1}{b}, \\frac{1}{c} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c}}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{abc}}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\( abc = 1 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{abc}} = \\sqrt[3]{1} = 1.\n\\]\n\nThus, we can conclude:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} \\geq 3.\n\\]\n\nThis shows that \\( C \\) can be at least 3. To check if \\( C = 3 \\) is indeed the largest constant, we need to verify if the equality can be achieved.\n\nThe equality in the AM-GM inequality holds when all the terms are equal, i.e., when \\( \\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{1}{c} \\). This occurs when \\( a = b = c \\). Given \\( abc = 1 \\), we can set \\( a = b = c = 1 \\). In this case:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1} = 3.\n\\]\n\nThus, the inequality holds with equality when \\( a = b = c = 1 \\).\n\nSince we have shown that \\( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} \\geq 3 \\) for all positive \\( a, b, c \\) such that \\( abc = 1 \\), and that this bound is achievable, we conclude that the largest constant \\( C \\) satisfying the inequality is:\n\n\\[\nC = 3.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe answer is \\( C=3 \\).",
