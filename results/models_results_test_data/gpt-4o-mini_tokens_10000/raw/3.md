Solution:

## Response

To solve the problem, we start with the condition given:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(ab + bc + ca).
\]

We can rearrange this equation:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 0.
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{1}{2}((a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2) = 0.
\]

This implies that \(a = b = c\). Let's denote \(a = b = c = k\) for some non-zero \(k\). 

Now, we substitute \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the inequality we want to analyze:

\[
(a+b+c)\left(\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right).
\]

Substituting \(a = b = c = k\):

\[
(3k)\left(\frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k} + \frac{1}{k}\right) = 3k \cdot \frac{3}{k} = 9.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
(a+b+c)\left(\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right) = 9.
\]

Since \(a = b = c\) is the only case that satisfies the condition \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(ab + bc + ca)\), we can conclude that the expression \( (a+b+c)\left(\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right) \) achieves its minimum value of 9 when \(a = b = c\).

Therefore, the largest constant \(C\) such that the inequality holds for all \(a, b, c\) satisfying the given condition is:

\[
C = 9.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=9.
\]
