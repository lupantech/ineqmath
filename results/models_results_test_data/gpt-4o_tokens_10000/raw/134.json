    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given expression and determine the correct inequality relation between the two sides.\n\nWe have a triangle \\( ABC \\) with point \\( P \\) inside it. The distances from \\( P \\) to the sides \\( BC, CA, \\) and \\( AB \\) are \\( d_a, d_b, \\) and \\( d_c \\) respectively. The altitudes from vertices \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) to the opposite sides are \\( h_a, h_b, \\) and \\( h_c \\).\n\nThe expression we need to analyze is:\n\n\\[\nd_a \\cdot h_a^2 + d_b \\cdot h_b^2 + d_c \\cdot h_c^2 \\quad () \\quad (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Terms\n\n- \\( d_a, d_b, d_c \\) are the perpendicular distances from point \\( P \\) to the sides of the triangle.\n- \\( h_a, h_b, h_c \\) are the altitudes of the triangle, which are fixed for a given triangle.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Expression\n\nThe left side of the inequality is a weighted sum of the squares of the altitudes, with weights being the distances from \\( P \\) to the sides. The right side is the cube of the sum of these distances.\n\n### Step 3: Consider Special Cases\n\n1. **Case when \\( P \\) is the centroid:**\n\n   When \\( P \\) is the centroid, the distances \\( d_a, d_b, d_c \\) are such that they are proportional to the areas of the sub-triangles \\( PBC, PCA, \\) and \\( PAB \\). In this case, the expression simplifies due to symmetry, but it doesn't directly help in comparing the two sides.\n\n2. **Case when \\( P \\) is on a side:**\n\n   If \\( P \\) is on one of the sides, say \\( BC \\), then \\( d_a = 0 \\) and \\( d_b, d_c \\) are the distances from \\( P \\) to the sides \\( CA \\) and \\( AB \\). The expression becomes:\n\n   \\[\n   d_b \\cdot h_b^2 + d_c \\cdot h_c^2 \\quad () \\quad (d_b + d_c)^3\n   \\]\n\n   This is still not straightforward to compare without specific values.\n\n### Step 4: General Consideration\n\nThe expression \\( d_a \\cdot h_a^2 + d_b \\cdot h_b^2 + d_c \\cdot h_c^2 \\) is a linear combination of the squares of the altitudes, while \\( (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3 \\) is a cubic expression. Generally, for positive values, a cubic expression grows faster than a linear one, suggesting that:\n\n\\[\nd_a \\cdot h_a^2 + d_b \\cdot h_b^2 + d_c \\cdot h_c^2 \\leq (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3\n\\]\n\nHowever, without loss of generality, the inequality might not hold strictly for all configurations, especially when \\( P \\) approaches the centroid or other symmetric points.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the nature of the expressions and typical behavior of linear versus cubic growth, the most reasonable inequality is:\n\n\\[\nd_a \\cdot h_a^2 + d_b \\cdot h_b^2 + d_c \\cdot h_c^2 \\leq (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct inequality relation is:\n\nThe answer is (A) \\(\\leq\\).",
