## Response

To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct inequality relation between the two expressions:

1. \(\sqrt{x(y+1)} + \sqrt{y(z+1)} + \sqrt{z(x+1)}\)
2. \(2 \sqrt{(x+1)(y+1)(z+1)}\)

Let's analyze the expressions and see if we can establish a relationship between them.

### Step 1: Simplify and Analyze

First, consider the expression \(\sqrt{x(y+1)}\). We can rewrite it as:
\[
\sqrt{x(y+1)} = \sqrt{xy + x}
\]

Similarly, the other terms are:
\[
\sqrt{y(z+1)} = \sqrt{yz + y}
\]
\[
\sqrt{z(x+1)} = \sqrt{zx + z}
\]

The right-hand side of the inequality is:
\[
2 \sqrt{(x+1)(y+1)(z+1)}
\]

### Step 2: Apply the AM-GM Inequality

The Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality states that for non-negative real numbers \(a, b, c\), we have:
\[
\frac{a + b + c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc}
\]

Let's apply AM-GM to the terms under the square roots on the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{x(y+1) + y(z+1) + z(x+1)}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{x(y+1) \cdot y(z+1) \cdot z(x+1)}
\]

### Step 3: Compare the Two Sides

To compare the two sides, we need to consider the structure of the expressions. Notice that:
- The left-hand side involves the sum of three square roots.
- The right-hand side is a single square root multiplied by 2.

To establish a relationship, consider specific values for \(x, y, z\). A common approach is to test with \(x = y = z = 1\):
- Left-hand side: \(\sqrt{1 \cdot 2} + \sqrt{1 \cdot 2} + \sqrt{1 \cdot 2} = 3\sqrt{2}\)
- Right-hand side: \(2 \sqrt{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = 4\)

Clearly, \(3\sqrt{2} \approx 4.24\) is greater than 4, suggesting that the left-hand side is greater than the right-hand side for these values.

### Step 4: Generalize the Result

The test case suggests that the left-hand side is generally greater than the right-hand side. To generalize, consider the symmetry and positivity of the expressions. The left-hand side involves terms that are individually larger due to the presence of \(x, y, z\) in each term, while the right-hand side is a product of terms that are incremented by 1.

Thus, the inequality holds in general:
\[
\sqrt{x(y+1)} + \sqrt{y(z+1)} + \sqrt{z(x+1)} > 2 \sqrt{(x+1)(y+1)(z+1)}
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:

The answer is (E) $>$.
