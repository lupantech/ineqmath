## Response

To solve the problem, we need to determine the correct inequality relation between the expression on the left-hand side (LHS) and the expression on the right-hand side (RHS).

**Step 1: Simplify the RHS**

The RHS is given as:
\[ 6 - \sqrt[3]{6} - \frac{5}{4} \sqrt[3]{36}. \]

First, simplify \(\sqrt[3]{36}\):
\[
\sqrt[3]{36} = \sqrt[3]{6^2} = (\sqrt[3]{6})^2.
\]

Substitute this into the RHS:
\[
6 - \sqrt[3]{6} - \frac{5}{4} (\sqrt[3]{6})^2.
\]

Let \( y = \sqrt[3]{6} \). Then the RHS becomes:
\[
6 - y - \frac{5}{4} y^2.
\]

**Step 2: Analyze the LHS**

The LHS is:
\[ x^2 + \frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)}. \]

The term \(\frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)}\) is always positive because the denominator is positive for all real \(x\). Therefore, the LHS is always greater than or equal to \(x^2\).

**Step 3: Compare LHS and RHS**

We need to determine the relationship between:
\[ x^2 + \frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)} \quad \text{and} \quad 6 - y - \frac{5}{4} y^2. \]

Since \(\frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)} > 0\), it follows that:
\[ x^2 + \frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)} > x^2. \]

Now, consider the minimum value of \(x^2\), which is 0 (when \(x = 0\)). Thus:
\[ x^2 + \frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)} > 0. \]

**Step 4: Evaluate the RHS**

Calculate the numerical value of the RHS:
- \( y = \sqrt[3]{6} \approx 1.817 \).
- \( y^2 = (\sqrt[3]{6})^2 \approx 3.303 \).

Substitute these into the RHS:
\[
6 - 1.817 - \frac{5}{4} \times 3.303 \approx 6 - 1.817 - 4.12875 \approx 0.05425.
\]

**Step 5: Compare the values**

The LHS is always greater than 0, and the RHS is approximately 0.05425. Therefore, for all real \(x\), the LHS is greater than the RHS.

Thus, the correct inequality relation is:
\[ x^2 + \frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)} > 6 - \sqrt[3]{6} - \frac{5}{4} \sqrt[3]{36}. \]

The answer is (E) $>$.
