## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the configuration of the isosceles triangle \(\triangle ABC\) with \(\overline{AB} = \overline{AC}\) and the tangents to its circumcircle at points \(A\) and \(B\).

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - Let \(O\) be the circumcenter of \(\triangle ABC\).
   - The tangents at \(A\) and \(B\) intersect at point \(D\).
   - Since \(DA\) and \(DB\) are tangents to the circumcircle, we have \(\angle DAB = \angle DBA = 90^\circ - \angle BAC\).

2. **Analyzing \(\angle DCB\):**
   - We need to find \(\angle DCB\).
   - Note that \(\angle DCB\) is an external angle to \(\triangle ABC\) at vertex \(C\).
   - By the external angle theorem, \(\angle DCB = \angle DAB + \angle ABC\).

3. **Expressing \(\angle DCB\) in terms of \(\angle BAC\):**
   - Since \(\triangle ABC\) is isosceles with \(\overline{AB} = \overline{AC}\), we have \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB\).
   - Let \(\angle BAC = \alpha\). Then \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \alpha}{2}\).
   - Therefore, \(\angle DAB = 90^\circ - \alpha\).
   - Thus, \(\angle DCB = \angle DAB + \angle ABC = (90^\circ - \alpha) + \frac{180^\circ - \alpha}{2}\).

4. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - \(\angle DCB = 90^\circ - \alpha + \frac{180^\circ - \alpha}{2}\).
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     \angle DCB = 90^\circ - \alpha + 90^\circ - \frac{\alpha}{2} = 180^\circ - \frac{3\alpha}{2}.
     \]

5. **Finding the Maximum of \(\angle DCB\):**
   - To find the maximum value of \(\angle DCB\), we need to minimize \(\frac{3\alpha}{2}\).
   - The minimum value of \(\alpha\) is \(0^\circ\) (as \(\alpha\) approaches \(0^\circ\), \(\triangle ABC\) becomes degenerate).
   - Therefore, the maximum value of \(\angle DCB\) is when \(\alpha = 0^\circ\):
     \[
     \angle DCB = 180^\circ - \frac{3 \times 0^\circ}{2} = 180^\circ.
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The inequality \(\angle DCB \leq C\) holds for all such triangles if \(C = 180^\circ\).

Thus, the minimal constant \(C\) such that the inequality holds for all such triangles is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C = 180^\circ.
