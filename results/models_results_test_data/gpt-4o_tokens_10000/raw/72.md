Problem: For any acute triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with sides \( a, b, c \), circumradius \( R \), and inradius \( r \), find the largest constant \( C \) such that the following inequality holds:
$$
a + b + c \geq CR+2r.
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
a + b + c \geq CR + 2r
\]

holds for any acute triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with sides \( a, b, c \), circumradius \( R \), and inradius \( r \).

### Step 1: Known Inequalities

For any triangle, we have the well-known inequalities:

1. **Euler's Inequality**: \( R \geq 2r \).
2. **Triangle Inequality**: \( a + b + c > 2R + 2r \).

### Step 2: Expressing the Perimeter in Terms of \( R \) and \( r \)

The semiperimeter \( s \) of the triangle is given by:

\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]

The area \( K \) of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius \( r \) and the semiperimeter \( s \) as:

\[
K = rs
\]

The area can also be expressed in terms of the circumradius \( R \) and the sides \( a, b, c \) as:

\[
K = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]

### Step 3: Relating \( a + b + c \) to \( R \) and \( r \)

Using the identity for the area, we have:

\[
rs = \frac{abc}{4R}
\]

Thus, the semiperimeter \( s \) is:

\[
s = \frac{abc}{4Rr}
\]

Therefore, the perimeter \( a + b + c = 2s \) is:

\[
a + b + c = \frac{abc}{2Rr}
\]

### Step 4: Finding the Largest \( C \)

We need to ensure:

\[
\frac{abc}{2Rr} \geq CR + 2r
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
\frac{abc}{2Rr} - 2r \geq CR
\]

Using the inequality \( R \geq 2r \), we have:

\[
\frac{abc}{2Rr} - 2r \geq C \cdot 2r
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{abc}{2Rr} \geq 2r(C + 1)
\]

### Step 5: Testing Known Values

For an equilateral triangle, where \( a = b = c \), \( R = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} \), and \( r = \frac{a}{2\sqrt{3}} \), we have:

\[
a + b + c = 3a
\]

\[
CR + 2r = C \cdot \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} + a \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

Setting these equal gives:

\[
3a \geq C \cdot \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} + \frac{2a}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

\[
3 \geq C \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

\[
3\sqrt{3} \geq C + 2
\]

\[
C \leq 3\sqrt{3} - 2
\]

### Conclusion

The largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for any acute triangle is:

\[
C = 3\sqrt{3} - 2
\]

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{C = 3\sqrt{3} - 2}\).
