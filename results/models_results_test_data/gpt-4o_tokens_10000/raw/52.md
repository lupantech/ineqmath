## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that for any real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\) satisfying \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^3 = 0\), the inequality \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \leq Cn\) holds.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Constraint:**
   The condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^3 = 0\) implies that the cubes of the numbers \( x_i \) sum to zero. This condition is crucial in determining the behavior of the numbers \( x_i \).

2. **Exploring the Extremes:**
   Since each \( x_i \) is in the interval \([-1, 1]\), the function \( f(x) = x^3 \) is odd and symmetric about the origin. This means that positive and negative values can cancel each other out to satisfy the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^3 = 0\).

3. **Constructing a Test Case:**
   Consider a simple case where half of the numbers are \( 1 \) and the other half are \(-1\). Specifically, let \( x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_{n/2} = 1 \) and \( x_{n/2+1} = x_{n/2+2} = \cdots = x_n = -1 \). This satisfies:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^3 = \frac{n}{2} \cdot 1^3 + \frac{n}{2} \cdot (-1)^3 = \frac{n}{2} - \frac{n}{2} = 0.
   \]
   The sum \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\) is:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \frac{n}{2} \cdot 1 + \frac{n}{2} \cdot (-1) = 0.
   \]

4. **Generalizing the Test Case:**
   The above construction shows that it is possible for \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 0\) while satisfying the cube sum condition. However, we need to find the smallest \( C \) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \leq Cn\) for all possible configurations of \( x_i \).

5. **Considering Other Configurations:**
   If we consider configurations where some \( x_i \) are positive and others are negative, the sum \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\) can be positive but is limited by the constraint \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^3 = 0\). The maximum possible value of \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\) occurs when the positive values are maximized and the negative values are minimized, but still satisfy the cube sum condition.

6. **Finding the Maximum Sum:**
   To maximize \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\), consider \( x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_k = 1 \) and \( x_{k+1} = x_{k+2} = \cdots = x_n = -1 \) such that:
   \[
   k \cdot 1^3 + (n-k) \cdot (-1)^3 = 0 \implies k - (n-k) = 0 \implies k = \frac{n}{2}.
   \]
   Thus, the sum is:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = k \cdot 1 + (n-k) \cdot (-1) = \frac{n}{2} - \frac{n}{2} = 0.
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   The maximum possible value of \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\) given the constraints is 0. Therefore, the smallest constant \( C \) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \leq Cn\) for all configurations is \( C = 0 \).

The answer is \(\boxed{C=0}\).
