## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{a^2}{b^2} + \frac{b^2}{c^2} + \frac{c^2}{a^2} \geq 2C \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]

holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( a + b + c = abc \).

### Step 1: Simplify the Problem

First, consider the condition \( a + b + c = abc \). This condition suggests a potential substitution. If we let \( a = \frac{x}{y}, b = \frac{y}{z}, c = \frac{z}{x} \), then:

\[
a + b + c = \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{z} + \frac{z}{x}
\]

and

\[
abc = \frac{x}{y} \cdot \frac{y}{z} \cdot \frac{z}{x} = 1.
\]

Thus, the condition \( a + b + c = abc \) simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{z} + \frac{z}{x} = 1.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Inequality

The inequality becomes:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{y}{z}\right)^2} + \frac{\left(\frac{y}{z}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{z}{x}\right)^2} + \frac{\left(\frac{z}{x}\right)^2}{\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^2} \geq 2C \sqrt{\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{y}{z}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{z}{x}\right)^2}
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\frac{x^2 z^2}{y^4} + \frac{y^2 x^2}{z^4} + \frac{z^2 y^2}{x^4} \geq 2C \sqrt{\frac{x^2}{y^2} + \frac{y^2}{z^2} + \frac{z^2}{x^2}}
\]

### Step 3: Test Specific Values

To find the largest \( C \), test specific values of \( a, b, c \). Consider the symmetric case where \( a = b = c \). Then \( a + b + c = 3a = a^3 \), so \( a = \sqrt{3} \).

Substitute \( a = b = c = \sqrt{3} \) into the inequality:

\[
\frac{(\sqrt{3})^2}{(\sqrt{3})^2} + \frac{(\sqrt{3})^2}{(\sqrt{3})^2} + \frac{(\sqrt{3})^2}{(\sqrt{3})^2} = 3
\]

and

\[
2C \sqrt{3(\sqrt{3})^2} = 2C \sqrt{9} = 6C.
\]

Thus, the inequality becomes:

\[
3 \geq 6C \quad \Rightarrow \quad C \leq \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Verify \( C = \frac{1}{2} \)

To verify that \( C = \frac{1}{2} \) is achievable, consider the inequality:

\[
\frac{a^2}{b^2} + \frac{b^2}{c^2} + \frac{c^2}{a^2} \geq \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]

This is a known inequality that holds for all positive \( a, b, c \). Therefore, \( C = \frac{1}{2} \) is indeed the largest constant for which the inequality holds.

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}
\]

The answer is \( C = \frac{1}{2} \).
