## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the behavior of the sequence \((a_n)_{n \geq 0}\) given the recursive inequality:

\[
a_{n+1} \geq a_n^2 + \frac{1}{5}
\]

We are tasked with determining the relationship between \(\sqrt{a_{n+5}}\) and \(a_{n-5}^2\) for \(n \geq 5\).

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The inequality \(a_{n+1} \geq a_n^2 + \frac{1}{5}\) suggests that the sequence \((a_n)\) is non-decreasing and potentially increasing rapidly, especially if \(a_n \geq 1\).

2. **Behavior of the Sequence:**
   - If \(a_n \geq 1\), then \(a_{n+1} \geq a_n^2 + \frac{1}{5} \geq 1^2 + \frac{1}{5} = 1.2\).
   - This implies that once \(a_n\) becomes greater than or equal to 1, it will continue to increase, and each subsequent term will be significantly larger than the previous one.

3. **Comparing \(\sqrt{a_{n+5}}\) and \(a_{n-5}^2\):**
   - We need to compare \(\sqrt{a_{n+5}}\) with \(a_{n-5}^2\).
   - Given the recursive inequality, \(a_{n+5}\) is expected to be much larger than \(a_{n-5}\) due to the exponential-like growth from squaring terms.

4. **Bounding \(a_{n+5}\):**
   - Consider the growth from \(a_n\) to \(a_{n+5}\):
     \[
     a_{n+1} \geq a_n^2 + \frac{1}{5}
     \]
     \[
     a_{n+2} \geq (a_{n+1})^2 + \frac{1}{5} \geq (a_n^2 + \frac{1}{5})^2 + \frac{1}{5}
     \]
     - Continuing this process, \(a_{n+5}\) will be significantly larger than \(a_n\).

5. **Inequality Analysis:**
   - Since \(a_{n+5}\) grows rapidly, \(\sqrt{a_{n+5}}\) will be much larger than \(a_{n-5}\).
   - Therefore, \(\sqrt{a_{n+5}} > a_{n-5}^2\) is a reasonable conclusion.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The inequality \(\sqrt{a_{n+5}} > a_{n-5}^2\) holds for \(n \geq 5\).

Thus, the correct inequality relation is:

\[
\sqrt{a_{n+5}} > a_{n-5}^2
\]

The answer is \((E) >\).
