    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality\n\n\\[\na + \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \\geq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all non-negative real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) with \\( a \\geq b \\geq 0 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the expression\n\nThe expression involves \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in the form \\( a + \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \\). We need to ensure that this expression is well-defined. The term \\( \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \\) is undefined when \\( b(a-b) = 0 \\). This occurs in two cases:\n- \\( b = 0 \\)\n- \\( a = b \\)\n\n### Step 2: Consider the case \\( b = 0 \\)\n\nIf \\( b = 0 \\), the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\na + \\frac{1}{0 \\cdot (a-0)} = a + \\text{undefined}\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that the expression is not well-defined when \\( b = 0 \\). However, if we consider the limit as \\( b \\to 0^+ \\), we have:\n\n\\[\na + \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \\to a + \\frac{1}{0} = \\infty\n\\]\n\nThus, for \\( b \\) approaching zero, the expression tends to infinity, which does not provide a bound for \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 3: Consider the case \\( a = b \\)\n\nIf \\( a = b \\), the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\na + \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} = a + \\frac{1}{b \\cdot 0} = a + \\text{undefined}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the expression is not well-defined. However, if we consider the limit as \\( a \\to b^+ \\), we have:\n\n\\[\na + \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} \\to b + \\frac{1}{b \\cdot 0^+} = b + \\infty = \\infty\n\\]\n\nThus, for \\( a \\) approaching \\( b \\), the expression also tends to infinity.\n\n### Step 4: Consider \\( a > b > 0 \\)\n\nFor \\( a > b > 0 \\), the expression is well-defined. We need to find the minimum value of:\n\n\\[\na + \\frac{1}{b(a-b)}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( a \\geq b > 0 \\), let's try to find a lower bound. Consider the case when \\( a = b + \\epsilon \\) for a small positive \\( \\epsilon \\). Then:\n\n\\[\na + \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} = (b + \\epsilon) + \\frac{1}{b\\epsilon}\n\\]\n\nAs \\( \\epsilon \\to 0^+ \\), the term \\( \\frac{1}{b\\epsilon} \\to \\infty \\), so the expression tends to infinity.\n\n### Step 5: Find the minimum value for specific \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)\n\nTo find a specific lower bound, consider \\( a = 2b \\). Then:\n\n\\[\na + \\frac{1}{b(a-b)} = 2b + \\frac{1}{b(b)} = 2b + \\frac{1}{b^2}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( b = 1 \\), this becomes:\n\n\\[\n2 \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{1^2} = 2 + 1 = 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression can be as small as 3 for specific values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe smallest value that the expression can take, considering all cases, is 3. Therefore, the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality holds for all \\( a \\geq b \\geq 0 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \\( C = 3 \\).",
