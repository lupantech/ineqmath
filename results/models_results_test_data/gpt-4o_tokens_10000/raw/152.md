## Response

To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct inequality relation between the given expression and \(\frac{4}{a+b}\).

The expression we are considering is:

\[
S = \frac{x}{3a y + b z} + \frac{y}{a z + 2b x} + \frac{z}{a x + b y}
\]

We want to compare \(S\) with \(\frac{4}{a+b}\).

### Step 1: Analyze the Expression

Each term in the expression \(S\) is of the form \(\frac{\text{variable}}{\text{linear combination of other variables}}\). This suggests that we might be able to apply an inequality like the AM-GM inequality or Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

### Step 2: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Consider applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the following form:

\[
\left( \frac{x}{3a y + b z} + \frac{y}{a z + 2b x} + \frac{z}{a x + b y} \right) \left( x(3a y + b z) + y(a z + 2b x) + z(a x + b y) \right) \geq (x + y + z)^2
\]

The left side of the inequality simplifies to:

\[
x(3a y + b z) + y(a z + 2b x) + z(a x + b y) = 3a x y + b x z + a y z + 2b x y + a x z + b y z
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
= 3a x y + 2b x y + a y z + b y z + a x z + b x z
\]

\[
= (3a + 2b) x y + (a + b) y z + (a + b) x z
\]

Thus, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives us:

\[
S \cdot ((3a + 2b) x y + (a + b) y z + (a + b) x z) \geq (x + y + z)^2
\]

### Step 3: Simplify and Compare

To compare \(S\) with \(\frac{4}{a+b}\), we need to analyze the structure of the inequality further. However, without loss of generality, assume \(a = b = 1\) to simplify the analysis:

\[
S = \frac{x}{3y + z} + \frac{y}{z + 2x} + \frac{z}{x + y}
\]

We want to compare this with \(\frac{4}{2} = 2\).

### Step 4: Test with Specific Values

Let's test with specific values to gain insight. Assume \(x = y = z = 1\):

\[
S = \frac{1}{3 \cdot 1 + 1} + \frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 1} + \frac{1}{1 + 1}
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2}
\]

\[
= \frac{3}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{6}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Since \(\frac{13}{12} \approx 1.0833\) and \(2 > 1.0833\), this suggests that \(S < 2\).

### Conclusion

The inequality \(S < \frac{4}{a+b}\) holds for the specific case tested, and the structure of the problem suggests this is generally true. Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:

\[
\boxed{<}
\]

The answer is \((D) <\).
