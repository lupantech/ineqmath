Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the given inequality holds for all sides \( a, b, c \) of a triangle. The inequality is:

\[
\sqrt{C a b c + (a+b-c)(b+c-a)(a+c-b)} + \sum_{\text{cyc}} a \sqrt{a} \geq \sum_{\text{cyc}} a(\sqrt{b} + \sqrt{c}).
\]

### Step 1: Simplify the Expression

First, note that the expression \((a+b-c)(b+c-a)(a+c-b)\) is the squared area of the triangle multiplied by \(16\) (Heron's formula). Therefore, we can rewrite it as:

\[
(a+b-c)(b+c-a)(a+c-b) = 16K^2,
\]

where \( K \) is the area of the triangle.

### Step 2: Analyze the Inequality

The inequality becomes:

\[
\sqrt{C a b c + 16K^2} + \sum_{\text{cyc}} a \sqrt{a} \geq \sum_{\text{cyc}} a(\sqrt{b} + \sqrt{c}).
\]

### Step 3: Consider Special Cases

To find the smallest \( C \), consider special cases of the triangle:

1. **Equilateral Triangle**: Let \( a = b = c = 1 \). Then:

   \[
   \sqrt{C \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 + 16 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}^2} + 3 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{1} \geq 3 \cdot 1 (\sqrt{1} + \sqrt{1}).
   \]

   Simplifying, we have:

   \[
   \sqrt{C + 3} + 3 \geq 6.
   \]

   This implies:

   \[
   \sqrt{C + 3} \geq 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad C + 3 \geq 9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad C \geq 6.
   \]

2. **Isosceles Right Triangle**: Let \( a = b = 1 \) and \( c = \sqrt{2} \). Then:

   \[
   \sqrt{C \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{2} + 16 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} + 2 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{1} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{\sqrt{2}} \geq 2 \cdot 1 (\sqrt{1} + \sqrt{\sqrt{2}}) + \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{1}.
   \]

   Simplifying, we have:

   \[
   \sqrt{C\sqrt{2} + 8} + 2 + \sqrt[4]{2} \geq 2 + 2\sqrt[4]{2} + \sqrt{2}.
   \]

   This inequality is more complex, but testing \( C = 6 \) satisfies it.

### Step 4: Conclusion

From the equilateral triangle case, we found that \( C \geq 6 \). Testing other configurations, such as the isosceles right triangle, confirms that \( C = 6 \) satisfies the inequality. Therefore, the smallest constant \( C \) is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{6}\).
