## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\min \left\{x_{i-1}, x_i\right\} \cdot \max \left\{x_i, x_{i+1}\right\}}{x_i} \leq C
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) satisfying \( x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n = 1 \).

### Step-by-step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Expression:**

   For each term in the sum, we have:

   \[
   \frac{\min \left\{x_{i-1}, x_i\right\} \cdot \max \left\{x_i, x_{i+1}\right\}}{x_i}
   \]

   This expression can be rewritten as:

   \[
   \frac{\min \left\{x_{i-1}, x_i\right\}}{x_i} \cdot \max \left\{x_i, x_{i+1}\right\}
   \]

   The term \(\frac{\min \left\{x_{i-1}, x_i\right\}}{x_i}\) is at most 1, and \(\max \left\{x_i, x_{i+1}\right\}\) is at most 1 because \(x_i + x_{i+1} \leq 1\).

2. **Bounding the Expression:**

   Consider the worst-case scenario where the terms are maximized. We need to find a configuration of \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) that maximizes the sum.

3. **Special Case Analysis:**

   Let's consider the case where \( n = 2 \) and \( x_1 = x_2 = \frac{1}{2} \). Then:

   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{\min \left\{x_{i-1}, x_i\right\} \cdot \max \left\{x_i, x_{i+1}\right\}}{x_i} = 2 \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1
   \]

   This suggests that \( C \geq 1 \).

4. **General Case:**

   For any \( n \), consider the configuration where all \( x_i = \frac{1}{n} \). Then:

   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\min \left\{x_{i-1}, x_i\right\} \cdot \max \left\{x_i, x_{i+1}\right\}}{x_i} = n \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{1}{n}}{\frac{1}{n}} = n \cdot \frac{1}{n} = 1
   \]

   This confirms that \( C = 1 \) is achievable.

5. **Conclusion:**

   Since the sum is always less than or equal to 1 for any configuration of \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) that sums to 1, the smallest constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all such configurations is indeed 1.

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) is:

\[
\text{The answer is } C=1
\]
