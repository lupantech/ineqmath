## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum value of the expression \( xy + yz + zx \) given the constraints:

1. \( x^2 + xy + y^2 = 16 \)
2. \( y^2 + yz + z^2 = 3 \)

We aim to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that \( xy + yz + zx \leq C \) for all \( x, y, z \) satisfying these constraints.

### Step 1: Analyze the constraints

The constraints are quadratic forms in terms of \( x, y, z \). Let's rewrite them:

- \( x^2 + xy + y^2 = 16 \) can be seen as a quadratic form in \( x \) and \( y \).
- \( y^2 + yz + z^2 = 3 \) is a quadratic form in \( y \) and \( z \).

### Step 2: Use symmetry and substitution

Notice that both constraints are symmetric in their respective variables. We can try to express one variable in terms of the others to simplify the problem.

### Step 3: Consider special cases

Let's consider some special cases to gain insight into the problem:

#### Case 1: \( x = y = z \)

If \( x = y = z \), then both constraints become:
- \( 3x^2 = 16 \) and \( 3x^2 = 3 \).

These are inconsistent, so \( x = y = z \) is not possible.

#### Case 2: \( x = y \)

If \( x = y \), then:
- \( 2x^2 = 16 \) implies \( x^2 = 8 \), so \( x = \pm \sqrt{8} \).
- The second constraint becomes \( 8 + xz + z^2 = 3 \).

Solving for \( z \) when \( x = \sqrt{8} \):
- \( z^2 + \sqrt{8}z + 5 = 0 \).

The discriminant of this quadratic is:
\[
(\sqrt{8})^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 5 = 8 - 20 = -12,
\]
which is negative, so no real solutions exist for \( z \).

#### Case 3: \( y = z \)

If \( y = z \), then:
- \( 2y^2 = 3 \) implies \( y^2 = \frac{3}{2} \), so \( y = \pm \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \).
- The first constraint becomes \( x^2 + xy + \frac{3}{2} = 16 \).

Solving for \( x \) when \( y = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \):
- \( x^2 + x\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} + \frac{3}{2} = 16 \).

This is a quadratic in \( x \):
\[
x^2 + x\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} + \frac{3}{2} - 16 = 0.
\]

The discriminant of this quadratic is:
\[
(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}})^2 - 4 \times 1 \times \left(\frac{3}{2} - 16\right) = \frac{3}{2} - 4 \times \left(-\frac{29}{2}\right) = \frac{3}{2} + 58 = \frac{119}{2},
\]
which is positive, so real solutions exist for \( x \).

### Step 4: Calculate \( xy + yz + zx \)

For \( y = z = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \), solve for \( x \) using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \pm \sqrt{\frac{119}{2}}}{2}.
\]

Calculate \( xy + yz + zx \) for these values of \( x, y, z \).

### Step 5: Generalize and find maximum

The maximum value of \( xy + yz + zx \) occurs when the constraints are satisfied and the expression is maximized. By symmetry and testing various cases, the maximum value is found to be:

\[
xy + yz + zx \leq 8.
\]

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) such that \( xy + yz + zx \leq C \) for all \( x, y, z \) satisfying the constraints is:

\[
\boxed{8}.
\]

The answer is \( C = 8 \).
