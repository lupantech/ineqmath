## Response

To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the expression on the left-hand side (LHS) and the expression on the right-hand side (RHS) of the inequality:

LHS: \(\frac{2a^2}{b} + \frac{3b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{a}\)

RHS: \(2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)\)

Given that \(a, b, c\) are positive real numbers and \(a + b + c = 1\), we will analyze the inequality.

### Step 1: Analyze the expressions

First, let's expand the RHS:

\[ 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2. \]

### Step 2: Compare terms

We need to compare each term on the LHS with the corresponding terms on the RHS:

1. Compare \(\frac{2a^2}{b}\) with \(2a^2\):
   - \(\frac{2a^2}{b} \geq 2a^2\) if \(b \leq a\).

2. Compare \(\frac{3b^2}{c}\) with \(2b^2\):
   - \(\frac{3b^2}{c} \geq 2b^2\) if \(c \leq \frac{3}{2}b\).

3. Compare \(\frac{c^2}{a}\) with \(2c^2\):
   - \(\frac{c^2}{a} \geq 2c^2\) if \(a \leq \frac{1}{2}c\).

### Step 3: Use AM-GM inequality

To further analyze, we can apply the AM-GM inequality to each term:

- For \(\frac{2a^2}{b}\), by AM-GM:
  \[
  \frac{2a^2}{b} + b \geq 2\sqrt{\frac{2a^2}{b} \cdot b} = 2a.
  \]

- For \(\frac{3b^2}{c}\), by AM-GM:
  \[
  \frac{3b^2}{c} + c \geq 2\sqrt{\frac{3b^2}{c} \cdot c} = 2\sqrt{3}b.
  \]

- For \(\frac{c^2}{a}\), by AM-GM:
  \[
  \frac{c^2}{a} + a \geq 2\sqrt{\frac{c^2}{a} \cdot a} = 2c.
  \]

### Step 4: Sum the inequalities

Summing these inequalities, we have:
\[
\left(\frac{2a^2}{b} + b\right) + \left(\frac{3b^2}{c} + c\right) + \left(\frac{c^2}{a} + a\right) \geq 2a + 2\sqrt{3}b + 2c.
\]

Since \(a + b + c = 1\), we can substitute and simplify:
\[
\frac{2a^2}{b} + \frac{3b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{a} + (a + b + c) \geq 2a + 2\sqrt{3}b + 2c.
\]

This implies:
\[
\frac{2a^2}{b} + \frac{3b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{a} \geq 2a + 2\sqrt{3}b + 2c - 1.
\]

### Conclusion

The inequality \(\frac{2a^2}{b} + \frac{3b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{a} \geq 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)\) holds under the given conditions. Therefore, the correct relation is:

The answer is (B) \(\geq\).
