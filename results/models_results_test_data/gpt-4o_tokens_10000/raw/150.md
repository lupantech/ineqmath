## Response

To solve this problem, we need to compare the two expressions:

1. \( \sqrt{\frac{2ab + bc + ca}{6}} \)
2. \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{(a+2b)(b+c)(3c+a)}{7}} \)

Let's analyze each expression separately and then compare them.

### Expression 1: \( \sqrt{\frac{2ab + bc + ca}{6}} \)

This expression is a square root of a weighted average of the products \( ab, bc, \) and \( ca \). Since \( a, b, c \) are non-negative, the expression inside the square root is non-negative, and thus the square root is well-defined.

### Expression 2: \( \sqrt[3]{\frac{(a+2b)(b+c)(3c+a)}{7}} \)

This expression is a cube root of a product of three terms, each of which is a linear combination of \( a, b, \) and \( c \). Again, since \( a, b, c \) are non-negative, each term is non-negative, and thus the cube root is well-defined.

### Comparison

To compare these two expressions, we can use the AM-GM inequality, which states that for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.

#### Applying AM-GM to Expression 1:

The expression inside the square root is:
\[
\frac{2ab + bc + ca}{6}
\]
By AM-GM, we have:
\[
\frac{2ab + bc + ca}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{(2ab)(bc)(ca)}
\]
Simplifying the right side:
\[
\sqrt[3]{2a^2b^2c^2} = \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot abc
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{2ab + bc + ca}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{2} \cdot abc
\]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[
\frac{2ab + bc + ca}{6} \geq \frac{\sqrt[3]{2} \cdot abc}{2}
\]

#### Applying AM-GM to Expression 2:

The expression inside the cube root is:
\[
\frac{(a+2b)(b+c)(3c+a)}{7}
\]
By AM-GM, we have:
\[
\frac{(a+2b) + (b+c) + (3c+a)}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{(a+2b)(b+c)(3c+a)}
\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[
\frac{a+2b + b+c + 3c+a}{3} = \frac{2a + 3b + 4c}{3}
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{2a + 3b + 4c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{(a+2b)(b+c)(3c+a)}
\]
Dividing both sides by 7:
\[
\frac{2a + 3b + 4c}{21} \geq \frac{\sqrt[3]{(a+2b)(b+c)(3c+a)}}{7}
\]

### Conclusion

Both expressions are non-negative and involve different combinations of \( a, b, \) and \( c \). Without loss of generality, consider the case where \( a = b = c = 0 \). In this case, both expressions evaluate to 0, indicating equality. However, for other non-negative values, the expressions can differ.

To determine the general inequality, consider the symmetry and the fact that both expressions are derived from non-negative terms. The AM-GM inequality suggests that the expressions are generally comparable, but without specific values, we cannot definitively state a strict inequality.

Thus, the most appropriate choice, considering the potential for equality and the nature of the expressions, is:

The answer is (C) $=$.
