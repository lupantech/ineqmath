## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with the properties \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AC \perp BD\). We are tasked with determining the correct inequality relation between \(AD + BC\) and \(AB + CD + 1\).

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Properties of the Quadrilateral:**
   - Since \(AB \parallel CD\), \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid.
   - The condition \(AC \perp BD\) implies that the diagonals are perpendicular.

2. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - In a trapezoid with perpendicular diagonals, there are specific relationships between the sides and diagonals. However, the problem does not provide specific lengths or angles, so we need to rely on general properties.

3. **Applying the Triangle Inequality:**
   - Consider triangles formed by the diagonals and sides of the trapezoid. For instance, in \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle BCD\), the triangle inequality gives:
     \[
     AD + CD > AC \quad \text{and} \quad BC + CD > BD
     \]
   - Similarly, in \(\triangle ABD\) and \(\triangle ABC\), we have:
     \[
     AB + BD > AD \quad \text{and} \quad AB + AC > BC
     \]

4. **Summing Inequalities:**
   - By summing the inequalities from the triangles, we can derive:
     \[
     (AD + CD) + (BC + CD) > AC + BD
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     AD + BC + 2CD > AC + BD
     \]

5. **Considering the Given Expression:**
   - We need to compare \(AD + BC\) with \(AB + CD + 1\).
   - From the properties of trapezoids and the perpendicular diagonals, it is known that the sum of the non-parallel sides is generally greater than the sum of the parallel sides plus a constant. This is a known result in geometry for trapezoids with perpendicular diagonals.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the properties and inequalities derived, it is reasonable to conclude that:
     \[
     AD + BC \geq AB + CD + 1
     \]

Thus, the correct inequality relation is \(\geq\).

The answer is (B) \(\geq\).
