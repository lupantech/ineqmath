## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the inequality:

\[
\frac{a}{1-a} \cdot \frac{b}{1-b} \cdot \frac{c}{1-c} \quad () \quad 8
\]

given the condition \(a + b + c = 2\) and \(a, b, c > 0\).

First, let's rewrite each term \(\frac{x}{1-x}\) in terms of a new variable. Define \(x = \frac{1}{1-y}\), which implies \(y = 1 - \frac{1}{x}\). Therefore, \(\frac{x}{1-x} = \frac{1}{y}\).

Now, consider the transformation:

\[
\frac{a}{1-a} = \frac{1}{x}, \quad \frac{b}{1-b} = \frac{1}{y}, \quad \frac{c}{1-c} = \frac{1}{z}
\]

where \(x = 1-a\), \(y = 1-b\), \(z = 1-c\). Then, \(a = 1-x\), \(b = 1-y\), \(c = 1-z\).

The condition \(a + b + c = 2\) becomes:

\[
(1-x) + (1-y) + (1-z) = 2
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
3 - (x + y + z) = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x + y + z = 1
\]

Now, we need to evaluate:

\[
\frac{a}{1-a} \cdot \frac{b}{1-b} \cdot \frac{c}{1-c} = \frac{1}{x} \cdot \frac{1}{y} \cdot \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

We want to compare \(\frac{1}{xyz}\) with 8. Since \(x + y + z = 1\), by the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[
\frac{x + y + z}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{xyz}
\]

Cubing both sides gives:

\[
\frac{1}{27} \geq xyz
\]

Taking the reciprocal (and reversing the inequality since all terms are positive):

\[
27 \leq \frac{1}{xyz}
\]

Thus, \(\frac{1}{xyz} \geq 27\).

Since we need to compare \(\frac{1}{xyz}\) with 8, and we have shown \(\frac{1}{xyz} \geq 27\), it follows that:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} > 8
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:

The answer is (E) $>$.
