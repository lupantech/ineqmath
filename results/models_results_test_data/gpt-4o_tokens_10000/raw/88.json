    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1+a^2} + \\frac{6}{5(1+b^2)} + \\frac{1}{1+c^2} \\geq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all non-negative \\( a, b, c \\) satisfying \\( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the expression\n\nFirst, consider the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1+a^2} + \\frac{6}{5(1+b^2)} + \\frac{1}{1+c^2}.\n\\]\n\nEach term is a decreasing function of its respective variable, meaning that as \\( a^2 \\), \\( b^2 \\), or \\( c^2 \\) increases, the value of the term decreases.\n\n### Step 2: Consider boundary cases\n\nTo find the minimum value of the expression, consider boundary cases where one or more of the variables are zero.\n\n#### Case 1: \\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = 1 \\)\n\nIn this case, \\( a^2 + b + c^2 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \\).

The expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1+1^2} + \\frac{6}{5(1+0^2)} + \\frac{1}{1+0^2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{6}{5} + 1 = 0.5 + 1.2 + 1 = 2.7.\n\\]\n\n#### Case 3: \\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), \\( c = 0 \\)\n\nIn this case, \\( a^2 + b + c^2 = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 \\).
