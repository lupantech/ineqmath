## Response

To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct inequality relation between the expression on the left-hand side and the expression on the right-hand side. We are given:

\[
\sqrt[n]{\frac{a}{b+c}} + \sqrt[n]{\frac{b}{c+a}} + \sqrt[n]{\frac{c}{a+b}}
\]

and we need to compare it to:

\[
\frac{n}{n-1} \sqrt[n]{n-1}.
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the Left-Hand Side

The left-hand side consists of three terms, each of the form \(\sqrt[n]{\frac{x}{y+z}}\) where \(x, y, z\) are cyclic permutations of \(a, b, c\). Each term is a positive real number since \(a, b, c > 0\).

### Step 2: Analyze the Right-Hand Side

The right-hand side is a constant expression for given \(n\):

\[
\frac{n}{n-1} \sqrt[n]{n-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Use Known Inequalities

To compare these expressions, we can use the AM-GM inequality, which states that for non-negative numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k\),

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k}{k} \geq \sqrt[k]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_k}.
\]

Applying AM-GM to the terms \(\frac{a}{b+c}, \frac{b}{c+a}, \frac{c}{a+b}\), we have:

\[
\frac{\frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c+a} + \frac{c}{a+b}}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{\frac{a}{b+c} \cdot \frac{b}{c+a} \cdot \frac{c}{a+b}}.
\]

The product \(\frac{a}{b+c} \cdot \frac{b}{c+a} \cdot \frac{c}{a+b}\) is known to be less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{8}\) by Nesbitt's inequality, which states:

\[
\frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c+a} + \frac{c}{a+b} \geq \frac{3}{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Simplify and Compare

We need to compare:

\[
\sqrt[n]{\frac{a}{b+c}} + \sqrt[n]{\frac{b}{c+a}} + \sqrt[n]{\frac{c}{a+b}}
\]

with

\[
\frac{n}{n-1} \sqrt[n]{n-1}.
\]

For \(n = 2\), the right-hand side becomes \(2\), and the left-hand side is at least \(\frac{3}{2}\) by Nesbitt's inequality. For \(n > 2\), the right-hand side increases, but the left-hand side remains bounded by the properties of the AM-GM inequality and Nesbitt's inequality.

### Conclusion

The inequality holds for \(n \geq 2\) as:

\[
\sqrt[n]{\frac{a}{b+c}} + \sqrt[n]{\frac{b}{c+a}} + \sqrt[n]{\frac{c}{a+b}} \leq \frac{n}{n-1} \sqrt[n]{n-1}.
\]

Thus, the correct inequality relation is:

The answer is (A) \(\leq\).
