## Response

To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the expression 

\[
\frac{1}{2a+b} + \frac{1}{b+c} + \frac{1}{c+a} + \frac{1}{a+2b+c}
\]

and the number 4, given that \( ab + bc + ca = 1 \) and \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}_0^{+} \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Expression

The expression consists of four terms, each of which is a fraction with a linear combination of \( a, b, \) and \( c \) in the denominator. We need to compare the sum of these fractions to 4.

### Step 2: Consider Special Cases

Let's consider some special cases to gain insight into the inequality.

#### Case 1: \( a = b = c \)

If \( a = b = c \), then \( ab + bc + ca = 3a^2 = 1 \), so \( a^2 = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \).

Substitute \( a = b = c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \) into the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{2a+b} = \frac{1}{3a} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{b+c} = \frac{1}{2a} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{c+a} = \frac{1}{2a} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{a+2b+c} = \frac{1}{4a} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}
\]

The sum is:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \sqrt{3} \left( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \right)
\]

Calculate the sum of the coefficients:

\[
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{12} + \frac{6}{12} + \frac{6}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{19}{12}
\]

Thus, the sum is:

\[
\sqrt{3} \times \frac{19}{12} \approx 2.74
\]

This is less than 4.

### Step 3: General Argument

The expression involves terms of the form \(\frac{1}{x}\) where \(x\) is a sum of non-negative terms. By the AM-GM inequality, the sum of these terms is minimized when the terms are equal, which is the case we considered. Since the sum was less than 4 in this symmetric case, it suggests that the inequality holds generally.

### Conclusion

The expression is less than 4 for the symmetric case and likely for all non-negative \(a, b, c\) satisfying \(ab + bc + ca = 1\). Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:

\[
\frac{1}{2a+b} + \frac{1}{b+c} + \frac{1}{c+a} + \frac{1}{a+2b+c} < 4
\]

The answer is \((D) <\).
