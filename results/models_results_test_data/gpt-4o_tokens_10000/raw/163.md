## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given inequality:

\[
\frac{1}{a+2b+1} + \frac{1}{3b+c+1} + \frac{1}{2c+a+1} \quad () \quad \frac{3}{2}.
\]

We are given that \( ab + ac + bc = 3 \) and \( a, b, c \geq 0 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the expression

The expression on the left-hand side is a sum of three fractions. Each fraction has a denominator that is a linear combination of \( a, b, c \) plus 1. We need to compare this sum to \(\frac{3}{2}\).

### Step 2: Consider symmetry and possible equalities

Since \( ab + ac + bc = 3 \), one possible scenario is when \( a = b = c \). Let's explore this case:

- If \( a = b = c \), then \( 3a^2 = 3 \), so \( a^2 = 1 \) and \( a = 1 \).
- Thus, \( a = b = c = 1 \).

Substitute \( a = b = c = 1 \) into the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + 2 \cdot 1 + 1} + \frac{1}{3 \cdot 1 + 1 + 1} + \frac{1}{2 \cdot 1 + 1 + 1} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Calculate the sum:

\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{5}{10} + \frac{2}{10} = \frac{7}{10}.
\]

This is less than \(\frac{3}{2}\).

### Step 3: Consider other possible values

To ensure that this inequality holds generally, consider the case where one of the variables is zero, say \( c = 0 \).

Then \( ab = 3 \) and the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{a+2b+1} + \frac{1}{3b+1} + \frac{1}{a+1}.
\]

If \( a = 0 \), then \( b^2 = 3 \), and the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2b+1} + \frac{1}{3b+1} + 1.
\]

For \( b = \sqrt{3} \), calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}+1} + \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}+1} + 1.
\]

This is also less than \(\frac{3}{2}\).

### Conclusion

In both cases, the sum of the fractions is less than \(\frac{3}{2}\). Therefore, the inequality is:

\[
\frac{1}{a+2b+1} + \frac{1}{3b+c+1} + \frac{1}{2c+a+1} < \frac{3}{2}.
\]

Thus, the correct option is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
