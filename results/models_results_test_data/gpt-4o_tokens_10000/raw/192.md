## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given inequality and the condition \( a + b + c = ab + bc + ca \).

First, let's rewrite the inequality we need to analyze:

\[
\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{a} + \frac{3n}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \quad () \quad 3 + n.
\]

We need to determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

### Step 1: Analyze the condition

The condition given is:

\[
a + b + c = ab + bc + ca.
\]

This is a symmetric condition, and it suggests that \( a, b, c \) might be related in a way that simplifies the inequality. One common scenario where this condition holds is when \( a = b = c = 1 \). Let's check if this satisfies the condition:

\[
1 + 1 + 1 = 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 = 3.
\]

This holds true, so \( a = b = c = 1 \) is a valid scenario.

### Step 2: Evaluate the inequality for \( a = b = c = 1 \)

Substitute \( a = b = c = 1 \) into the inequality:

\[
\frac{1^2}{1} + \frac{1^2}{1} + \frac{1^2}{1} + \frac{3n}{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = 1 + 1 + 1 + \frac{3n}{3}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
3 + n.
\]

The right-hand side of the inequality is also \( 3 + n \).

### Step 3: Determine the inequality relation

For \( a = b = c = 1 \), the expression evaluates to exactly \( 3 + n \). This suggests that the inequality is an equality in this case.

### Step 4: Consider other possible values

The condition \( a + b + c = ab + bc + ca \) is symmetric and holds for other symmetric cases, but the equality for \( a = b = c = 1 \) strongly suggests that the inequality is an equality in general, given the symmetry and the specific condition.

Thus, the correct inequality relation is:

\[
\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{a} + \frac{3n}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = 3 + n.
\]

Therefore, the answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is (C) } =.
\]
