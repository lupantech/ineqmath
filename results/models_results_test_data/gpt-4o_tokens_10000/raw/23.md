## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{a}{1-a} \cdot \frac{b}{1-b} \cdot \frac{c}{1-c} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( a + b + c = 2 \).

First, let's express each term \(\frac{x}{1-x}\) in terms of \( x \). For \( x \in (0, 1) \), the function \(\frac{x}{1-x}\) is increasing. Therefore, the product \(\frac{a}{1-a} \cdot \frac{b}{1-b} \cdot \frac{c}{1-c}\) is also increasing in each variable.

To find the minimum value of this product, we should consider the scenario where \( a, b, c \) are as equal as possible, given the constraint \( a + b + c = 2 \). The most symmetric case is when \( a = b = c = \frac{2}{3} \).

Let's calculate the product in this case:

\[
\frac{a}{1-a} = \frac{\frac{2}{3}}{1 - \frac{2}{3}} = \frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{1}{3}} = 2.
\]

Thus, for \( a = b = c = \frac{2}{3} \), the product is:

\[
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8.
\]

Now, we need to verify if this is indeed the minimum value. Consider the function:

\[
f(x) = \frac{x}{1-x}
\]

The second derivative of \( f(x) \) is positive for \( x \in (0, 1) \), indicating that \( f(x) \) is convex. By Jensen's inequality, for convex functions, the minimum value of the product \(\frac{a}{1-a} \cdot \frac{b}{1-b} \cdot \frac{c}{1-c}\) under the constraint \( a + b + c = 2 \) occurs when \( a = b = c = \frac{2}{3} \).

Therefore, the minimum value of the product is indeed 8, and the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a, b, c > 0 \) with \( a + b + c = 2 \) is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]

Thus, the answer is \( C = 8 \).
