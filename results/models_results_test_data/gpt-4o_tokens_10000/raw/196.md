## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the expression \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + \left|x^2 + y^2 + z^2\right| \) and determine its relationship with \(\frac{1}{8}\).

Given that \( |x + 2y + 3z| = 1 \), we know that the magnitude of the complex number \( x + 2y + 3z \) is 1. This constraint will be useful in our analysis.

### Step 1: Analyze the expression

The expression we are considering is:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + \left|x^2 + y^2 + z^2\right|
\]

This can be split into two cases based on the value of \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \):

1. **Case 1:** \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \geq 0 \)

   In this case, \(\left|x^2 + y^2 + z^2\right| = x^2 + y^2 + z^2\), so the expression becomes:
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
   \]

2. **Case 2:** \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 < 0 \)

   In this case, \(\left|x^2 + y^2 + z^2\right| = -(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)\), so the expression becomes:
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 0
   \]

### Step 2: Use the constraint \( |x + 2y + 3z| = 1 \)

The constraint \( |x + 2y + 3z| = 1 \) implies that the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of \( x + 2y + 3z \) is 1. This does not directly give us information about \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \), but it does suggest that the values of \( x, y, z \) are bounded in some way.

### Step 3: Consider the possible values of \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \)

- If \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \geq 0 \), then the expression is \( 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \geq 0 \).
- If \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 < 0 \), then the expression is \( 0 \).

### Step 4: Compare with \(\frac{1}{8}\)

- In the case where \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \geq 0 \), the expression \( 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \geq 0 \) is always greater than or equal to 0, which is greater than \(\frac{1}{8}\).
- In the case where \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 < 0 \), the expression is 0, which is less than \(\frac{1}{8}\).

### Conclusion

The expression \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + \left|x^2 + y^2 + z^2\right| \) can be either 0 or a positive value greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, it is not always greater than \(\frac{1}{8}\), nor is it always less than \(\frac{1}{8}\). However, it can be equal to 0, which is less than \(\frac{1}{8}\).

Thus, the correct inequality relation is:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + \left|x^2 + y^2 + z^2\right| \quad < \quad \frac{1}{8}
\]

The answer is (D) $<$.
