## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the inequality:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} + \frac{a_2}{a_3} + \cdots + \frac{a_n}{a_1} \quad () \quad 2n - 1.
\]

Given that each \( a_k > 1 \) and \(|a_k - a_{k+1}| \leq 1\), we need to determine the relationship between the sum of these fractions and \(2n - 1\).

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Terms:**
   - Each term \(\frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}}\) is close to 1 because \(|a_k - a_{k+1}| \leq 1\) and both \(a_k\) and \(a_{k+1}\) are greater than 1.
   - If \(a_k = a_{k+1}\), then \(\frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}} = 1\).
   - If \(a_k > a_{k+1}\), then \(\frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}} > 1\).
   - If \(a_k < a_{k+1}\), then \(\frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}} < 1\).

2. **Summing the Terms:**
   - The sum \(\frac{a_1}{a_2} + \frac{a_2}{a_3} + \cdots + \frac{a_n}{a_1}\) consists of \(n\) terms.
   - If all terms were exactly 1, the sum would be \(n\).

3. **Bounding the Sum:**
   - Since \(|a_k - a_{k+1}| \leq 1\), the deviation of each term \(\frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}}\) from 1 is limited.
   - Consider the extreme cases:
     - If \(a_k = a_{k+1} + 1\), then \(\frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}} = \frac{a_{k+1} + 1}{a_{k+1}} = 1 + \frac{1}{a_{k+1}}\).
     - If \(a_k = a_{k+1} - 1\), then \(\frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}} = \frac{a_{k+1} - 1}{a_{k+1}} = 1 - \frac{1}{a_{k+1}}\).

4. **Estimating the Total Sum:**
   - Each term \(\frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}}\) is close to 1, and the sum of deviations from 1 is limited by the fact that each deviation is at most \(\frac{1}{a_k}\) or \(\frac{1}{a_{k+1}}\).
   - Since \(a_k > 1\), each deviation is less than 1.

5. **Comparing to \(2n - 1\):**
   - The sum of \(n\) terms, each close to 1, is close to \(n\).
   - The maximum possible deviation from \(n\) is less than \(n\), so the sum cannot reach \(2n - 1\).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum \(\frac{a_1}{a_2} + \frac{a_2}{a_3} + \cdots + \frac{a_n}{a_1}\) is always less than \(2n - 1\).

Thus, the correct inequality relation is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} + \frac{a_2}{a_3} + \cdots + \frac{a_n}{a_1} < 2n - 1.
\]

The answer is \((D) <\).
