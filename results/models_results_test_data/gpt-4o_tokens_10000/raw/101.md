## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given inequality and determine the correct relation between the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS).

**Step 1: Simplify the LHS**

The LHS of the inequality is:

\[
\frac{a^2 + 2b^2}{ab + b^2} + \frac{b^2 + 2c^2}{bc + c^2} + \frac{c^2 + 2d^2}{cd + d^2}
\]

Each term can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{a^2 + 2b^2}{ab + b^2} = \frac{a^2}{ab + b^2} + \frac{2b^2}{ab + b^2}
\]

Notice that:

\[
\frac{a^2}{ab + b^2} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{a}{a + b} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{2b^2}{ab + b^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{b}{a + b}
\]

Thus, each term is a combination of fractions that depend on the ratios of \(a, b, c, d\).

**Step 2: Simplify the RHS**

The RHS of the inequality is:

\[
\sqrt[3]{\frac{54a}{a+d}}
\]

**Step 3: Analyze the inequality**

To compare the LHS and RHS, we need to consider the behavior of each term. Notice that:

- Each term in the LHS is a sum of fractions that are generally greater than or equal to 1, since:

  \[
  \frac{a^2 + 2b^2}{ab + b^2} \geq 1 \quad \text{(since \(a^2 + 2b^2 \geq ab + b^2\))}
  \]

- The RHS is a cube root expression, which is generally less than or equal to the sum of the terms in the LHS for positive \(a, b, c, d\).

**Step 4: Consider specific values**

To gain more insight, consider specific values for \(a, b, c, d\). For simplicity, let \(a = b = c = d = 1\):

- LHS becomes:

  \[
  \frac{1^2 + 2 \cdot 1^2}{1 \cdot 1 + 1^2} + \frac{1^2 + 2 \cdot 1^2}{1 \cdot 1 + 1^2} + \frac{1^2 + 2 \cdot 1^2}{1 \cdot 1 + 1^2} = 3 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
  \]

- RHS becomes:

  \[
  \sqrt[3]{\frac{54 \cdot 1}{1 + 1}} = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3
  \]

Since \(\frac{9}{2} > 3\), the LHS is greater than the RHS for these values.

**Conclusion**

The analysis and specific example suggest that the LHS is generally greater than the RHS for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\). Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:

The answer is (E) $>$.
