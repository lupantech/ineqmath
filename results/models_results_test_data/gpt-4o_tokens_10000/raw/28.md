## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\left(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n\right)^2 \leq C \left(1^2 a_1^2 + 2^2 a_2^2 + \cdots + n^2 a_n^2\right)
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).

### Step 1: Consider the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the context of sequences states that for any sequences of real numbers \( (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \) and \( (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n) \), we have:

\[
(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2)(y_1^2 + y_2^2 + \cdots + y_n^2) \geq (x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + \cdots + x_n y_n)^2
\]

### Step 2: Apply Cauchy-Schwarz to Our Problem

Set \( x_i = a_i \) and \( y_i = i \). Then, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives:

\[
(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2)(1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2) \geq (a_1 \cdot 1 + a_2 \cdot 2 + \cdots + a_n \cdot n)^2
\]

The sum of squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers is:

\[
1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2) \cdot \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \geq (a_1 \cdot 1 + a_2 \cdot 2 + \cdots + a_n \cdot n)^2
\]

### Step 3: Relate to the Original Inequality

We want:

\[
(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)^2 \leq C (1^2 a_1^2 + 2^2 a_2^2 + \cdots + n^2 a_n^2)
\]

From the Cauchy-Schwarz result, we have:

\[
(a_1 \cdot 1 + a_2 \cdot 2 + \cdots + a_n \cdot n)^2 \leq \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2)
\]

To ensure the original inequality holds, we need:

\[
(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)^2 \leq \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2)
\]

Thus, the minimal constant \( C \) is:

\[
C = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

### Conclusion

The minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive real numbers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}}
\]

The answer is \( C = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \).
