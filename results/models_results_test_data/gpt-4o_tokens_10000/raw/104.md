## Response

To solve this problem, we need to compare the two expressions:

1. \( \sqrt{\frac{a+b}{2c}} + \sqrt{\frac{b+c}{2a}} + \sqrt{\frac{c+a}{2b}} \)
2. \( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \)

Given the condition \( a^3 + b^3 + 3c = 5 \), we need to determine the inequality relationship between these two expressions.

### Step 1: Analyze the expressions

The first expression involves square roots and fractions, while the second expression is a sum of reciprocals. To compare them, we can use inequalities and properties of symmetric sums.

### Step 2: Use AM-GM Inequality

The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. We can apply this to each term in the first expression:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a+b}{2c}} \geq \frac{a+b}{2c}
\]

Similarly, for the other terms:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{b+c}{2a}} \geq \frac{b+c}{2a}
\]
\[
\sqrt{\frac{c+a}{2b}} \geq \frac{c+a}{2b}
\]

### Step 3: Sum the inequalities

Summing these inequalities, we get:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a+b}{2c}} + \sqrt{\frac{b+c}{2a}} + \sqrt{\frac{c+a}{2b}} \geq \frac{a+b}{2c} + \frac{b+c}{2a} + \frac{c+a}{2b}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the second expression

Now, consider the second expression:

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}
\]

We need to compare:

\[
\frac{a+b}{2c} + \frac{b+c}{2a} + \frac{c+a}{2b} \quad \text{with} \quad \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}
\]

### Step 5: Use Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form of sums states:

\[
\left( \frac{a+b}{2c} + \frac{b+c}{2a} + \frac{c+a}{2b} \right) \left( 2c + 2a + 2b \right) \geq (1+1+1)^2 = 9
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
\frac{a+b}{2c} + \frac{b+c}{2a} + \frac{c+a}{2b} \geq \frac{9}{2(a+b+c)}
\]

### Step 6: Conclusion

Given the condition \( a^3 + b^3 + 3c = 5 \), and the nature of the expressions, it is reasonable to conclude that:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a+b}{2c}} + \sqrt{\frac{b+c}{2a}} + \sqrt{\frac{c+a}{2b}} \geq \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}
\]

Thus, the correct inequality relation is:

The answer is (B) $\geq$.
