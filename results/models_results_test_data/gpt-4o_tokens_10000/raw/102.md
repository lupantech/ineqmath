## Response

To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the semiperimeter \( s \) and the expression \( 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2 \) for an acute-angled triangle.

First, let's recall some important relationships and inequalities involving the circumradius \( R \), inradius \( r \), and semiperimeter \( s \) of a triangle:

1. **Euler's Inequality**: For any triangle, \( R \geq 2r \).
2. **Gerretsen's Inequality**: For any triangle, \( s^2 \leq 4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 \).

Since the triangle is acute-angled, we have additional properties:

- For an acute-angled triangle, it is known that \( s^2 < 4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 \).

Now, let's analyze the expression \( 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2 \) and compare it with \( s^2 \).

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Gerretsen's Inequality for Acute Triangles**:
   \[
   s^2 < 4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2
   \]

2. **Comparing \( 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2 \) with \( 4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 \)**:
   - We have:
     \[
     4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 = 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2 + 2R^2 - 4Rr
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 = 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2 + (2R^2 - 4Rr)
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 > 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2
     \]
   - This is because \( 2R^2 - 4Rr > 0 \) for an acute triangle, as \( R > 2r \).

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \( s^2 < 4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 \) and \( 4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 > 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2 \), it follows that:
     \[
     s^2 < 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2
     \]

Thus, the correct inequality relation is \( s^2 < 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2 \).

The answer is (D) $<$.
