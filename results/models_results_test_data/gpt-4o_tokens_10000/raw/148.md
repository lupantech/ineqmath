## Response

To solve this problem, we need to compare the two expressions:

1. \( \frac{a}{2b} + \frac{b}{4c} + \frac{c}{a} \)
2. \( \frac{3a}{b+c} + \frac{2b}{c+a} + \frac{3c}{a+b} \)

We will analyze each expression and try to determine their relationship.

### Step 1: Analyze the first expression

The first expression is:
\[
\frac{a}{2b} + \frac{b}{4c} + \frac{c}{a}
\]

This expression is a sum of three positive terms since \(a, b, c\) are sides of a triangle and thus positive.

### Step 2: Analyze the second expression

The second expression is:
\[
\frac{3a}{b+c} + \frac{2b}{c+a} + \frac{3c}{a+b}
\]

This expression is also a sum of three positive terms. The denominators \(b+c\), \(c+a\), and \(a+b\) are positive because they are sums of positive numbers.

### Step 3: Compare the expressions

To compare these expressions, we can use some known inequalities or test specific cases. One useful inequality for triangles is Nesbitt's inequality, which states:
\[
\frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c+a} + \frac{c}{a+b} \geq \frac{3}{2}
\]

However, our second expression is a weighted version of this, and we need to compare it with the first expression.

### Step 4: Test specific cases

Let's test a specific case where \(a = b = c\). In this case, the triangle is equilateral.

- For the first expression:
  \[
  \frac{a}{2a} + \frac{a}{4a} + \frac{a}{a} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + 1 = \frac{7}{4}
  \]

- For the second expression:
  \[
  \frac{3a}{2a} + \frac{2a}{2a} + \frac{3a}{2a} = \frac{3}{2} + 1 + \frac{3}{2} = 3
  \]

In this case, \(\frac{7}{4} < 3\).

### Step 5: Generalize the result

The specific case suggests that the first expression is generally less than the second expression. To generalize, consider that the second expression is a weighted sum of terms that are each larger than or equal to \(\frac{1}{2}\) due to Nesbitt's inequality, while the first expression has smaller coefficients and larger denominators.

Thus, the inequality holds in general:

\[
\frac{a}{2b} + \frac{b}{4c} + \frac{c}{a} < \frac{3a}{b+c} + \frac{2b}{c+a} + \frac{3c}{a+b}
\]

The answer is \((D) <\).
