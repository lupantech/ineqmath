    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimal constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x y z}{(1+3x)(x+8y)(y+9z)(z+6)} \\leq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all positive \\( x, y, z \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Denominator\n\nThe denominator of the fraction is:\n\n\\[\n(1+3x)(x+8y)(y+9z)(z+6).\n\\]\n\nEach factor in the denominator is a linear function of one of the variables, with positive coefficients. This suggests that the denominator grows quite rapidly as any of the variables increase.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the Behavior as Variables Approach Zero\n\nTo find the minimal \\( C \\), consider the behavior of the expression as \\( x, y, z \\to 0^+ \\). In this case, the denominator approaches:\n\n\\[\n(1+3 \\cdot 0)(0+8 \\cdot 0)(0+9 \\cdot 0)(0+6) = 1 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 6 = 0.\n\\]\n\nHowever, since \\( x, y, z > 0 \\), we should consider small positive values. Let's analyze the expression when \\( x, y, z \\) are very small but positive.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Expression for Small Values\n\nFor small \\( x, y, z \\), the denominator can be approximated as:\n\n\\[\n(1+3x) \\approx 1, \\quad (x+8y) \\approx 8y, \\quad (y+9z) \\approx 9z, \\quad (z+6) \\approx 6.\n\\]\n\nThus, the denominator is approximately:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot 8y \\cdot 9z \\cdot 6 = 432yz.\n\\]\n\nThe numerator is \\( xyz \\). Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{xyz}{432yz} = \\frac{x}{432}.\n\\]\n\nAs \\( x \\to 0^+ \\), this expression approaches 0, which suggests that the inequality holds for very small values of \\( x, y, z \\).\n\n### Step 4: Consider the Behavior as Variables Increase\n\nNow consider the case where one of the variables is large, say \\( x \\to \\infty \\). The denominator becomes:\n\n\\[\n(1+3x)(x+8y)(y+9z)(z+6) \\approx 3x \\cdot x \\cdot y \\cdot z = 3x^2yz.\n\\]\n\nThe numerator is \\( xyz \\), so the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{xyz}{3x^2yz} = \\frac{1}{3x}.\n\\]\n\nAs \\( x \\to \\infty \\), this expression approaches 0, which again suggests that the inequality holds.\n\n### Step 5: Find the Maximum Value\n\nTo find the maximum value of the expression, consider setting \\( x = y = z = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1}{(1+3 \\cdot 1)(1+8 \\cdot 1)(1+9 \\cdot 1)(1+6)} = \\frac{1}{4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 7} = \\frac{1}{2520}.\n\\]\n\nThis is a candidate for the maximum value of the expression.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe maximum value of the expression, when \\( x = y = z = 1 \\), is \\(\\frac{1}{2520}\\). Therefore, the minimal constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality holds for all positive \\( x, y, z \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2520}}\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{C = \\frac{1}{2520}}\\).",
