Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the given inequality holds for all positive real numbers \( x, y, z \):

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{x(y+z)^2}{2x+y+z} + \frac{9}{2}\left(\frac{x+y+z}{xy+yz+zx}\right)^2 \geq C + \frac{9}{2(xy+yz+zx)}
\]

### Step 1: Simplify the Problem

First, let's analyze the structure of the inequality. The left-hand side consists of two main terms:

1. \(\sum_{cyc} \frac{x(y+z)^2}{2x+y+z}\)
2. \(\frac{9}{2}\left(\frac{x+y+z}{xy+yz+zx}\right)^2\)

The right-hand side consists of:

1. \(C\)
2. \(\frac{9}{2(xy+yz+zx)}\)

### Step 2: Consider Symmetric Cases

To find the largest \( C \), consider symmetric cases where \( x = y = z = t \). This simplifies the problem significantly:

- \( xy + yz + zx = 3t^2 \)
- \( x+y+z = 3t \)

Substitute these into the inequality:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{t(2t)^2}{2t+t+t} = \sum_{cyc} \frac{4t^3}{4t} = 3t^2
\]

The second term becomes:

\[
\frac{9}{2} \left(\frac{3t}{3t^2}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{t^2}
\]

The right-hand side becomes:

\[
C + \frac{9}{2 \cdot 3t^2} = C + \frac{3}{2t^2}
\]

### Step 3: Equate and Solve

Equating the simplified expressions for the symmetric case:

\[
3t^2 + \frac{9}{2t^2} \geq C + \frac{3}{2t^2}
\]

Simplify:

\[
3t^2 + \frac{9}{2t^2} - \frac{3}{2t^2} \geq C
\]

\[
3t^2 + \frac{6}{2t^2} \geq C
\]

\[
3t^2 + \frac{3}{t^2} \geq C
\]

### Step 4: Minimize the Expression

To find the minimum value of \( 3t^2 + \frac{3}{t^2} \), consider the function \( f(t) = 3t^2 + \frac{3}{t^2} \). Find its critical points by differentiating:

\[
f'(t) = 6t - \frac{6}{t^3}
\]

Set \( f'(t) = 0 \):

\[
6t = \frac{6}{t^3}
\]

\[
t^4 = 1 \implies t = 1
\]

Evaluate \( f(t) \) at \( t = 1 \):

\[
f(1) = 3(1)^2 + \frac{3}{1^2} = 3 + 3 = 6
\]

Thus, the minimum value of \( 3t^2 + \frac{3}{t^2} \) is 6.

### Conclusion

The largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( x, y, z \) is 6. Therefore, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{C=6}
\]
