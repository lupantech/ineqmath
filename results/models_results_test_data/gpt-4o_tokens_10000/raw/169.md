## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the expression \((\sec A - 1)(\sec B - 1)(\sec C - 1)\) for an acute-angled triangle with angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).

### Step 1: Understanding the Secant Function
For an acute angle \(\theta\), the secant function is defined as \(\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}\). Since \(\theta\) is acute, \(\cos \theta > 0\), and thus \(\sec \theta > 1\).

### Step 2: Expression Analysis
The expression \((\sec A - 1)(\sec B - 1)(\sec C - 1)\) involves the product of three positive terms, since each \(\sec\) term is greater than 1 for acute angles. Therefore, each \(\sec \theta - 1 > 0\).

### Step 3: Simplifying the Expression
Let's consider the expression in more detail:
- \(\sec A - 1 = \frac{1}{\cos A} - 1 = \frac{1 - \cos A}{\cos A}\).
- Similarly, \(\sec B - 1 = \frac{1 - \cos B}{\cos B}\) and \(\sec C - 1 = \frac{1 - \cos C}{\cos C}\).

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
(\sec A - 1)(\sec B - 1)(\sec C - 1) = \left(\frac{1 - \cos A}{\cos A}\right)\left(\frac{1 - \cos B}{\cos B}\right)\left(\frac{1 - \cos C}{\cos C}\right).
\]

### Step 4: Using the AM-GM Inequality
For any acute angle \(\theta\), \(1 - \cos \theta\) is positive and less than 1. We can apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms \(1 - \cos A\), \(1 - \cos B\), and \(1 - \cos C\):
\[
\frac{(1 - \cos A) + (1 - \cos B) + (1 - \cos C)}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{(1 - \cos A)(1 - \cos B)(1 - \cos C)}.
\]

Since \(A + B + C = \pi\), and each angle is acute, we have:
\[
1 - \cos A + 1 - \cos B + 1 - \cos C < 3.
\]

Thus, the geometric mean \(\sqrt[3]{(1 - \cos A)(1 - \cos B)(1 - \cos C)} < 1\).

### Step 5: Conclusion
Since each \(\sec \theta - 1 > 0\) and the product is positive, but less than 1, we conclude:
\[
(\sec A - 1)(\sec B - 1)(\sec C - 1) < 1.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:
\[
(\sec A - 1)(\sec B - 1)(\sec C - 1) \quad < \quad 1.
\]

The answer is \((D) <\).
