## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\prod_{i=1}^{2022}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{2022} a_{i j}^2\right) \geq C \left(\sum_{j=1}^{2022} \prod_{i=1}^{2022} a_{i j}\right)^2
\]

holds for all \( a_{ij} \in [-2022, 2022] \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Structure of the Inequality

The left-hand side of the inequality is a product of sums of squares:

\[
\prod_{i=1}^{2022}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{2022} a_{i j}^2\right)
\]

The right-hand side involves the square of a sum of products:

\[
C \left(\sum_{j=1}^{2022} \prod_{i=1}^{2022} a_{i j}\right)^2
\]

### Step 2: Consider Special Cases

To find the largest \( C \), consider special cases where the inequality might be tight.

#### Case 1: All \( a_{ij} = 0 \)

In this case, both sides of the inequality are zero, so the inequality holds for any \( C \).

#### Case 2: All \( a_{ij} = 1 \)

- Left-hand side: Each sum \(\sum_{j=1}^{2022} a_{ij}^2 = 2022\), so the product is \(2022^{2022}\).
- Right-hand side: Each product \(\prod_{i=1}^{2022} a_{ij} = 1\), so the sum is \(2022\), and its square is \(2022^2\).

The inequality becomes:

\[
2022^{2022} \geq C \times 2022^2
\]

Solving for \( C \), we get:

\[
C \leq 2022^{2020}
\]

#### Case 3: All \( a_{ij} = -1 \)

This is similar to Case 2, and the same bound for \( C \) applies.

### Step 3: General Consideration

The inequality is a form of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in a product form. The left-hand side is a product of sums of squares, and the right-hand side is a square of a sum of products. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in this context suggests that the bound found in the special cases is indeed the largest possible.

### Conclusion

The largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a_{ij} \in [-2022, 2022] \) is:

\[
\boxed{2022^{2020}}
\]

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{2022^{2020}}\).

The answer is \( C = 2022^{2020} \).
