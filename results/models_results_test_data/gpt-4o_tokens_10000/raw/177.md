## Response

To solve this problem, we need to compare the expression on the left-hand side (LHS) with the expression on the right-hand side (RHS) of the inequality.

The LHS is:
\[
\frac{1}{a^2 + ab} + \frac{3}{b^2 + 2bc} + \frac{2}{2c^2 + ca}
\]

The RHS is:
\[
\frac{1}{(abc)^{2/3}}
\]

We will analyze each term on the LHS and compare it with the RHS.

### Step 1: Simplify and Analyze Each Term

1. **First Term: \(\frac{1}{a^2 + ab}\)**

   We have:
   \[
   a^2 + ab = a(a + b)
   \]
   Since \(a, b > 0\), we have \(a^2 + ab > 0\). Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{1}{a^2 + ab} < \frac{1}{a^2}
   \]

2. **Second Term: \(\frac{3}{b^2 + 2bc}\)**

   We have:
   \[
   b^2 + 2bc = b(b + 2c)
   \]
   Since \(b, c > 0\), we have \(b^2 + 2bc > 0\). Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{3}{b^2 + 2bc} < \frac{3}{b^2}
   \]

3. **Third Term: \(\frac{2}{2c^2 + ca}\)**

   We have:
   \[
   2c^2 + ca = c(2c + a)
   \]
   Since \(c, a > 0\), we have \(2c^2 + ca > 0\). Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2c^2 + ca} < \frac{2}{2c^2} = \frac{1}{c^2}
   \]

### Step 2: Compare with the RHS

The RHS is:
\[
\frac{1}{(abc)^{2/3}}
\]

### Step 3: Use AM-GM Inequality

To compare the LHS and RHS, we can use the AM-GM inequality. Consider the terms:
\[
a^2 + ab, \quad b^2 + 2bc, \quad 2c^2 + ca
\]

By AM-GM:
\[
a^2 + ab \geq 2a^{3/2}b^{1/2}, \quad b^2 + 2bc \geq 3b^{4/3}c^{2/3}, \quad 2c^2 + ca \geq 3c^{4/3}a^{2/3}
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{1}{a^2 + ab} \leq \frac{1}{2a^{3/2}b^{1/2}}, \quad \frac{3}{b^2 + 2bc} \leq \frac{3}{3b^{4/3}c^{2/3}}, \quad \frac{2}{2c^2 + ca} \leq \frac{2}{3c^{4/3}a^{2/3}}
\]

Summing these inequalities:
\[
\frac{1}{a^2 + ab} + \frac{3}{b^2 + 2bc} + \frac{2}{2c^2 + ca} \leq \frac{1}{2a^{3/2}b^{1/2}} + \frac{1}{b^{4/3}c^{2/3}} + \frac{2}{3c^{4/3}a^{2/3}}
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion

The LHS is less than or equal to the RHS by AM-GM inequality. Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:
\[
\frac{1}{a^2 + ab} + \frac{3}{b^2 + 2bc} + \frac{2}{2c^2 + ca} \leq \frac{1}{(abc)^{2/3}}
\]

Thus, the answer is \((A) \leq\).

The answer is (A) $\leq$.
