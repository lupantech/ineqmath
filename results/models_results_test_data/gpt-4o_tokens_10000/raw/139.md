## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given condition and the expressions involved. We are given that:

\[
\frac{1}{a+b+1} + \frac{1}{b+c+1} + \frac{1}{c+a+1} \geq 1
\]

and we need to determine the relationship between \( a+b+c \) and \( ab+bc+ca + 1 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the given inequality

The inequality involves three fractions, each of which is positive since \( a, b, c > 0 \). The sum of these fractions is at least 1. We can use the AM-HM inequality to gain insight:

\[
\frac{1}{a+b+1} + \frac{1}{b+c+1} + \frac{1}{c+a+1} \geq \frac{9}{2(a+b+c)+3}
\]

This inequality holds because the harmonic mean of three positive numbers is less than or equal to their arithmetic mean.

### Step 2: Simplify the inequality

Given the condition, we have:

\[
\frac{9}{2(a+b+c)+3} \geq 1
\]

Solving this inequality:

\[
9 \geq 2(a+b+c) + 3
\]

\[
6 \geq 2(a+b+c)
\]

\[
3 \geq a+b+c
\]

### Step 3: Relate \( a+b+c \) and \( ab+bc+ca + 1 \)

We have found that \( a+b+c \leq 3 \). Now, we need to compare \( a+b+c \) with \( ab+bc+ca + 1 \).

Consider the identity:

\[
(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab+bc+ca)
\]

From this, we have:

\[
ab+bc+ca = \frac{(a+b+c)^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}{2}
\]

Since \( a, b, c > 0 \), by the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq 3\sqrt[3]{a^2b^2c^2} > 0
\]

Thus:

\[
ab+bc+ca < \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Compare \( a+b+c \) and \( ab+bc+ca + 1 \)

Since \( a+b+c \leq 3 \), we have:

\[
ab+bc+ca + 1 < \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{2} + 1
\]

For \( a+b+c = 3 \), the maximum value of \( ab+bc+ca \) occurs when \( a = b = c = 1 \), giving:

\[
ab+bc+ca = 3
\]

Thus:

\[
ab+bc+ca + 1 = 4
\]

Since \( a+b+c \leq 3 \), it follows that:

\[
a+b+c \leq ab+bc+ca + 1
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality is:

\[
a+b+c \leq ab+bc+ca + 1
\]

The answer is \((A) \leq\).
