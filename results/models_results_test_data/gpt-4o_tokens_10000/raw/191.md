## Response

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the expression \(3ab + 4bc + 5ca\) and \(\frac{5}{3}\) given that \(a + b + c = 1\).

First, let's express \(c\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\) using the condition \(a + b + c = 1\):
\[
c = 1 - a - b.
\]

Substitute \(c = 1 - a - b\) into the expression \(3ab + 4bc + 5ca\):
\[
3ab + 4b(1 - a - b) + 5a(1 - a - b).
\]

Expanding the terms, we have:
\[
3ab + 4b - 4ab - 4b^2 + 5a - 5a^2 - 5ab.
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
(3ab - 4ab - 5ab) + (4b - 4b^2) + (5a - 5a^2).
\]

Simplify:
\[
-6ab + 4b - 4b^2 + 5a - 5a^2.
\]

Now, let's analyze the expression. We want to find the maximum or minimum value of this expression to compare it with \(\frac{5}{3}\).

Consider the case where \(a = b = c = \frac{1}{3}\) (since \(a + b + c = 1\) and this is a symmetric point):
\[
3\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + 4\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + 5\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right).
\]

Calculate each term:
\[
3 \cdot \frac{1}{9} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{9} + 5 \cdot \frac{1}{9} = \frac{3}{9} + \frac{4}{9} + \frac{5}{9} = \frac{12}{9} = \frac{4}{3}.
\]

Now, compare \(\frac{4}{3}\) with \(\frac{5}{3}\):
\[
\frac{4}{3} < \frac{5}{3}.
\]

Thus, at the symmetric point \(a = b = c = \frac{1}{3}\), the expression \(3ab + 4bc + 5ca = \frac{4}{3}\), which is less than \(\frac{5}{3}\).

To ensure this is the maximum value, consider the expression's behavior. The expression is quadratic in nature, and the symmetric point often gives a critical point for such symmetric conditions. Since \(\frac{4}{3} < \frac{5}{3}\), and no other simple configuration of \(a, b, c\) (such as setting one variable to zero) yields a higher value, we conclude that the expression is always less than \(\frac{5}{3}\).

Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:
\[
3ab + 4bc + 5ca < \frac{5}{3}.
\]

The answer is (D) $<$.
