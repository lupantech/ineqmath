## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given condition \( a + b + c = abc \) and the inequality involving the sum of fractions with square roots in the denominators.

First, let's explore the condition \( a + b + c = abc \). This is a well-known condition that often appears in problems involving trigonometric identities. Specifically, if we set \( a = \tan A \), \( b = \tan B \), and \( c = \tan C \) for angles \( A, B, C \) of a triangle, then the identity \( \tan A + \tan B + \tan C = \tan A \tan B \tan C \) holds when \( A + B + C = \pi \).

Given this, we can assume \( a = \tan A \), \( b = \tan B \), and \( c = \tan C \) for angles \( A, B, C \) of a triangle. This implies that \( A + B + C = \pi \).

Now, consider the expression we need to evaluate:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2+1}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{b^2+1}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{c^2+1}}.
\]
Notice that for any angle \( \theta \), we have the identity:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\tan^2 \theta + 1}} = \cos \theta.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\cos A + \cos B + \cos C.
\]

For a triangle with angles \( A, B, C \), it is known that:
\[
\cos A + \cos B + \cos C \leq \frac{3}{2}.
\]
However, we need to compare this sum to \(\frac{5}{3}\).

To find the maximum value of \(\cos A + \cos B + \cos C\), consider the case when the triangle is equilateral, i.e., \( A = B = C = \frac{\pi}{3} \). In this case:
\[
\cos A = \cos B = \cos C = \cos \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\cos A + \cos B + \cos C = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}.
\]

Since \(\frac{3}{2} < \frac{5}{3}\), we conclude that:
\[
\cos A + \cos B + \cos C < \frac{5}{3}.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is \( < \).

The answer is (D) $<$.
