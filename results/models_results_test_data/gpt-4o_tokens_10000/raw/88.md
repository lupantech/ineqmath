## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{1}{1+a^2} + \frac{6}{5(1+b^2)} + \frac{1}{1+c^2} \geq C
\]

holds for all non-negative \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the expression

First, consider the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{1+a^2} + \frac{6}{5(1+b^2)} + \frac{1}{1+c^2}.
\]

Each term is a decreasing function of its respective variable, meaning that as \( a^2 \), \( b^2 \), or \( c^2 \) increases, the value of the term decreases.

### Step 2: Consider boundary cases

To find the minimum value of the expression, consider boundary cases where one or more of the variables are zero.

#### Case 1: \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), \( c = 1 \)

In this case, \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \). The expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1+0^2} + \frac{6}{5(1+0^2)} + \frac{1}{1+1^2} = 1 + \frac{6}{5} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 + 1.2 + 0.5 = 2.7.
\]

#### Case 2: \( a = 1 \), \( b = 0 \), \( c = 0 \)

In this case, \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1^2 + 0 + 0 = 1 \). The expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1+1^2} + \frac{6}{5(1+0^2)} + \frac{1}{1+0^2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{6}{5} + 1 = 0.5 + 1.2 + 1 = 2.7.
\]

#### Case 3: \( a = 0 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 0 \)

In this case, \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 \). The expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1+0^2} + \frac{6}{5(1+1^2)} + \frac{1}{1+0^2} = 1 + \frac{6}{10} + 1 = 1 + 0.6 + 1 = 2.6.
\]

### Step 3: Determine the minimum value

From the cases considered, the minimum value of the expression is \( 2.6 \), which occurs when \( a = 0 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 0 \).

### Conclusion

The largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( a^2 + b + c^2 = 1 \) is \( 2.6 \).

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{C=2.6}\).
