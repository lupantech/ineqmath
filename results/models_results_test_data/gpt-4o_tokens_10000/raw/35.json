    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality\n\n\\[\nd_a \\cdot h_a^2 + d_b \\cdot h_b^2 + d_c \\cdot h_c^2 \\geq C \\cdot (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3\n\\]\n\nholds for all points \\( P \\) inside the triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry\n\nThe distances \\( d_a, d_b, d_c \\) are the perpendicular distances from the point \\( P \\) to the sides \\( BC, CA, \\) and \\( AB \\) respectively. The altitudes \\( h_a, h_b, h_c \\) are the perpendicular distances from the vertices \\( A, B, C \\) to the opposite sides.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Expression\n\nThe left-hand side of the inequality is a weighted sum of the distances \\( d_a, d_b, d_c \\) with weights \\( h_a^2, h_b^2, h_c^2 \\). The right-hand side is a cubic expression in the sum of the distances.\n\n### Step 3: Special Case Analysis\n\nConsider the case where \\( P \\) is the centroid of the triangle. In this case, the distances \\( d_a, d_b, d_c \\) are proportional to the areas of the sub-triangles \\( PBC, PCA, PAB \\), and their sum is constant, equal to the area of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\n### Step 4: Homogenization\n\nThe inequality is homogeneous of degree 3 in \\( d_a, d_b, d_c \\). We can assume without loss of generality that \\( d_a + d_b + d_c = 1 \\). Then the inequality becomes:\n\n\\[\nd_a \\cdot h_a^2 + d_b \\cdot h_b^2 + d_c \\cdot h_c^2 \\geq C\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Testing Extremes\n\nConsider the case where \\( P \\) is very close to one of the vertices, say \\( A \\). In this case, \\( d_a \\approx 0 \\), and \\( d_b + d_c \\approx 1 \\). The left-hand side becomes approximately \\( d_b \\cdot h_b^2 + d_c \\cdot h_c^2 \\), which is minimized when \\( d_b = d_c = 0.5 \\). The right-hand side becomes \\( C \\).\n\n### Step 6: Using Known Results\n\nA known result in geometry is that the sum of the distances from any interior point to the sides of a triangle is constant and equal to the area of the triangle divided by the semiperimeter. This suggests that the inequality should hold with equality when \\( P \\) is the centroid.\n\n### Step 7: Calculating the Bound\n\nFor the centroid, the distances are \\( d_a = d_b = d_c = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{\\text{Area}}{s} \\), where \\( s \\) is the semiperimeter. The left-hand side becomes:\n\n\\[\n3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Area}}{s}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{h_a^2 + h_b^2 + h_c^2}{3}\n\\]\n\nThe right-hand side becomes:\n\n\\[\nC \\cdot \\left(3 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Area}}{s}\\right)^3\n\\]\n\nEquating these and solving for \\( C \\), we find that the largest \\( C \\) is achieved when the inequality holds with equality for the centroid, leading to:\n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality holds for all points \\( P \\) inside the triangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \\( C = \\frac{1}{4} \\).",
