## Response

To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct inequality relation between the two expressions:

1. \(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a}\)
2. \(3 \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2ab + 4bc + ca}}\)

Let's analyze each side of the inequality separately.

### Step 1: Analyze the Left Side

The expression \(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a}\) is a well-known cyclic sum. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a} \geq 3\sqrt[3]{\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{c} \cdot \frac{c}{a}} = 3
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Right Side

The expression on the right is \(3 \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2ab + 4bc + ca}}\).

To understand this expression, consider the case when \(a = b = c\). In this case:

- The left side becomes \(\frac{a}{a} + \frac{a}{a} + \frac{a}{a} = 3\).
- The right side becomes \(3 \sqrt{\frac{3a^2}{7a^2}} = 3 \sqrt{\frac{3}{7}}\).

Since \(\sqrt{\frac{3}{7}} < 1\), the right side is less than 3 in this case.

### Step 3: General Comparison

To compare the two sides in general, consider the inequality:

\[
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a} \geq 3 \geq 3 \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2ab + 4bc + ca}}
\]

The first inequality is due to the AM-GM inequality, and the second inequality holds because \(\sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2ab + 4bc + ca}} \leq 1\) for non-negative \(a, b, c\).

### Step 4: Conclusion

Since \(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a} \geq 3 \geq 3 \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2ab + 4bc + ca}}\), we conclude:

\[
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a} \geq 3 \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2ab + 4bc + ca}}
\]

Thus, the correct inequality relation is \(\geq\).

The answer is (B) \(\geq\).
