Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{a}{b + Cc} + \frac{b}{c + Ca} + \frac{c}{a + Cb} \geq 1
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \).

### Step 1: Consider Symmetric Case

First, consider the symmetric case where \( a = b = c \). In this case, the inequality becomes:

\[
\frac{a}{a + Ca} + \frac{a}{a + Ca} + \frac{a}{a + Ca} = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{1 + C} \geq 1.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{3}{1 + C} \geq 1.
\]

Solving for \( C \), we get:

\[
3 \geq 1 + C \quad \Rightarrow \quad C \leq 2.
\]

### Step 2: Consider the General Case

To ensure that \( C = 2 \) is indeed the largest constant, we need to verify that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) when \( C = 2 \).

Substitute \( C = 2 \) into the inequality:

\[
\frac{a}{b + 2c} + \frac{b}{c + 2a} + \frac{c}{a + 2b} \geq 1.
\]

### Step 3: Use Titu's Lemma (Cauchy-Schwarz in Engel Form)

Apply Titu's Lemma (a form of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality):

\[
\frac{a^2}{a(b + 2c)} + \frac{b^2}{b(c + 2a)} + \frac{c^2}{c(a + 2b)} \geq \frac{(a + b + c)^2}{ab + 2ac + bc + 2ba + ca + 2cb}.
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
ab + 2ac + bc + 2ba + ca + 2cb = 3(ab + bc + ca).
\]

Thus, the inequality becomes:

\[
\frac{(a + b + c)^2}{3(ab + bc + ca)} \geq 1.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(a + b + c)^2 \geq 3(ab + bc + ca).
\]

This is true by the AM-GM inequality, which states:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq ab + bc + ca.
\]

Thus, the inequality holds for \( C = 2 \).

### Step 4: Verify if \( C > 2 \) is Possible

If \( C > 2 \), consider the case where \( a = b = c \). The inequality becomes:

\[
\frac{3}{1 + C} < 1,
\]

which is not true for \( C > 2 \). Therefore, \( C = 2 \) is indeed the largest possible value.

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) for which the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]

The answer is \( C = 2 \).
