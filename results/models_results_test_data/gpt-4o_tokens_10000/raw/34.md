Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{b+c}{a} + \frac{c+a}{b} + \frac{a+b}{c} + \frac{(b+c-a)(c+a-b)(a+b-c)}{abc} \geq C
\]

holds for all side lengths \( a, b, c \) of a triangle, which satisfy the triangle inequalities \( a + b > c \), \( b + c > a \), and \( c + a > b \).

### Step 1: Simplify the Expression

First, consider the expression without the last term:

\[
\frac{b+c}{a} + \frac{c+a}{b} + \frac{a+b}{c}.
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{a}{b} + \frac{a}{c} + \frac{b}{c}.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Last Term

The last term is:

\[
\frac{(b+c-a)(c+a-b)(a+b-c)}{abc}.
\]

This term is non-negative because each factor \( b+c-a \), \( c+a-b \), and \( a+b-c \) is non-negative due to the triangle inequalities.

### Step 3: Consider Special Cases

To find the largest \( C \), consider the case when the triangle is equilateral, i.e., \( a = b = c \). In this case, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2c}{c} + \frac{2c}{c} + \frac{2c}{c} + \frac{(c+c-c)(c+c-c)(c+c-c)}{c^3} = 6 + 0 = 6.
\]

### Step 4: General Case

For a general triangle, the expression is:

\[
\frac{b+c}{a} + \frac{c+a}{b} + \frac{a+b}{c} \geq 6.
\]

This is a known inequality for the sides of a triangle, often derived from the AM-GM inequality or Nesbitt's inequality. The additional term \(\frac{(b+c-a)(c+a-b)(a+b-c)}{abc}\) is non-negative, so it only increases the left-hand side.

### Conclusion

The smallest value of the left-hand side occurs when the triangle is equilateral, giving a value of 6. Since the additional term is non-negative, the inequality holds for \( C = 6 \) in all cases.

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all triangles is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]

The answer is \( C = 6 \).
