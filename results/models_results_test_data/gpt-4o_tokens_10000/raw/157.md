## Response

To solve this problem, we need to compare the two expressions:

1. \( x^{x^2 + 2yz} y^{y^2 + 2zx} z^{z^2 + 2xy} \)
2. \( (xyz)^{xy + yz + zx} \)

Let's start by analyzing each expression.

### Expression 1:
\[ x^{x^2 + 2yz} y^{y^2 + 2zx} z^{z^2 + 2xy} \]

This expression can be rewritten using the properties of exponents:
\[ = x^{x^2} x^{2yz} y^{y^2} y^{2zx} z^{z^2} z^{2xy} \]
\[ = x^{x^2} y^{y^2} z^{z^2} \cdot x^{2yz} y^{2zx} z^{2xy} \]

### Expression 2:
\[ (xyz)^{xy + yz + zx} \]

This expression can be expanded as:
\[ = x^{xy + yz + zx} y^{xy + yz + zx} z^{xy + yz + zx} \]

### Comparing the Two Expressions:

To compare these expressions, let's consider the exponents of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) separately.

#### Exponent of \(x\):
- In Expression 1: \(x^{x^2 + 2yz}\)
- In Expression 2: \(x^{xy + yz + zx}\)

#### Exponent of \(y\):
- In Expression 1: \(y^{y^2 + 2zx}\)
- In Expression 2: \(y^{xy + yz + zx}\)

#### Exponent of \(z\):
- In Expression 1: \(z^{z^2 + 2xy}\)
- In Expression 2: \(z^{xy + yz + zx}\)

### Simplifying the Comparison:

For each variable, we need to compare the exponents:

1. **Exponent of \(x\):**
   - Expression 1: \(x^2 + 2yz\)
   - Expression 2: \(xy + yz + zx\)

2. **Exponent of \(y\):**
   - Expression 1: \(y^2 + 2zx\)
   - Expression 2: \(xy + yz + zx\)

3. **Exponent of \(z\):**
   - Expression 1: \(z^2 + 2xy\)
   - Expression 2: \(xy + yz + zx\)

### Using AM-GM Inequality:

For each variable, we can apply the AM-GM inequality:

- For \(x\): \(x^2 + 2yz \geq 3\sqrt[3]{x^2 \cdot yz \cdot yz} = 3xyz\)
- For \(y\): \(y^2 + 2zx \geq 3\sqrt[3]{y^2 \cdot zx \cdot zx} = 3xyz\)
- For \(z\): \(z^2 + 2xy \geq 3\sqrt[3]{z^2 \cdot xy \cdot xy} = 3xyz\)

Thus, for each variable, the exponent in Expression 1 is greater than or equal to the exponent in Expression 2.

### Conclusion:

Since the exponents in Expression 1 are greater than or equal to those in Expression 2 for each variable, we have:

\[ x^{x^2 + 2yz} y^{y^2 + 2zx} z^{z^2 + 2xy} \geq (xyz)^{xy + yz + zx} \]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation is \(\geq\).

The answer is (B) \(\geq\).
