## Response

To solve this problem, we need to compare the two sides of the given inequality:

\[
\frac{1}{1-x} + \frac{1}{1-y} + \frac{1}{1-z} \quad () \quad \left(1 + \frac{x+y+z}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1-xy} + \frac{1}{1-yz} + \frac{1}{1-zx}\right).
\]

Let's analyze each side separately.

### Left Side Analysis

The left side is:

\[
\frac{1}{1-x} + \frac{1}{1-y} + \frac{1}{1-z}.
\]

For \( x, y, z \in [0, 1) \), each term \(\frac{1}{1-x}\), \(\frac{1}{1-y}\), and \(\frac{1}{1-z}\) is well-defined and greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the sum is at least 3:

\[
\frac{1}{1-x} + \frac{1}{1-y} + \frac{1}{1-z} \geq 3.
\]

### Right Side Analysis

The right side is:

\[
\left(1 + \frac{x+y+z}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1-xy} + \frac{1}{1-yz} + \frac{1}{1-zx}\right).
\]

First, consider the factor \(1 + \frac{x+y+z}{3}\). Since \(x, y, z \in [0, 1)\), we have:

\[
0 \leq \frac{x+y+z}{3} < 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 \leq 1 + \frac{x+y+z}{3} < 2.
\]

Next, consider the sum \(\frac{1}{1-xy} + \frac{1}{1-yz} + \frac{1}{1-zx}\). Each term is also greater than or equal to 1, so:

\[
\frac{1}{1-xy} + \frac{1}{1-yz} + \frac{1}{1-zx} \geq 3.
\]

Thus, the right side is:

\[
\left(1 + \frac{x+y+z}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1-xy} + \frac{1}{1-yz} + \frac{1}{1-zx}\right) \geq 3.
\]

### Comparison

Both sides are at least 3. However, the left side is exactly 3 when \(x = y = z = 0\), and the right side is also exactly 3 in this case. For other values of \(x, y, z\), the right side can be greater than 3 because \(1 + \frac{x+y+z}{3} < 2\) and \(\frac{1}{1-xy} + \frac{1}{1-yz} + \frac{1}{1-zx} \geq 3\).

Therefore, the inequality is:

\[
\frac{1}{1-x} + \frac{1}{1-y} + \frac{1}{1-z} \leq \left(1 + \frac{x+y+z}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1-xy} + \frac{1}{1-yz} + \frac{1}{1-zx}\right).
\]

The answer is \((A) \leq\).
