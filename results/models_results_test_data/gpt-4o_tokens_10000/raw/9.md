Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{(2a+b+c)^2}{2a^2+(b+c)^2} + \frac{(2b+a+c)^2}{2b^2+(a+c)^2} + \frac{(2c+a+b)^2}{2c^2+(a+b)^2} \leq C
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \).

### Step 1: Symmetry and Homogeneity

The expression is symmetric in \( a, b, c \), and it is homogeneous of degree 0. This means that if we scale \( a, b, c \) by a positive constant, the expression remains unchanged. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume \( a + b + c = 1 \).

### Step 2: Simplifying the Expression

Let's analyze each term separately. Consider the first term:

\[
\frac{(2a+b+c)^2}{2a^2+(b+c)^2}.
\]

Expanding the numerator:

\[
(2a+b+c)^2 = 4a^2 + 4ab + 4ac + b^2 + 2bc + c^2.
\]

The denominator is:

\[
2a^2 + (b+c)^2 = 2a^2 + b^2 + 2bc + c^2.
\]

Thus, the first term becomes:

\[
\frac{4a^2 + 4ab + 4ac + b^2 + 2bc + c^2}{2a^2 + b^2 + 2bc + c^2}.
\]

### Step 3: Testing Specific Values

To find the smallest \( C \), we test specific values of \( a, b, c \).

#### Case 1: \( a = b = c = 1 \)

In this case, \( a + b + c = 3 \), so we normalize by setting \( a = b = c = \frac{1}{3} \).

Each term becomes:

\[
\frac{(2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3})^2}{2 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}\right)^2} = \frac{1^2}{\frac{2}{9} + \frac{4}{9}} = \frac{1}{\frac{6}{9}} = \frac{3}{2}.
\]

Thus, the sum of the three terms is:

\[
3 \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5.
\]

#### Case 2: \( a = 1, b = c = 0 \)

In this case, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{(2 \cdot 1 + 0 + 0)^2}{2 \cdot 1^2 + (0+0)^2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2.
\]

The other terms are zero, so the total is 2.

### Step 4: Conclusion

From the above cases, the maximum value of the expression is 4.5 when \( a = b = c = \frac{1}{3} \). Testing other symmetric cases or using inequalities like AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz does not yield a larger value. Therefore, the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) is:

\[
\boxed{4.5}
\]

Thus, the answer is \( C = 4.5 \).

The answer is \( C = 4.5 \).
