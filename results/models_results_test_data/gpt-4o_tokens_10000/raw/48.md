## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\sum_{\text{cyc}} a \frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc} \geq C \sum_{\text{cyc}} 3a
\]

holds for all positive \( a, b, c \). Let's start by expanding the cyclic sum:

\[
\sum_{\text{cyc}} a \frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc} = a \frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc} + b \frac{c^2+a^2}{b^2+ca} + c \frac{a^2+b^2}{c^2+ab}.
\]

We need to show that this expression is greater than or equal to \( C(3a + 3b + 3c) = 3C(a + b + c) \).

To find the largest \( C \), we can test specific cases. A common approach is to test symmetric cases, such as when \( a = b = c \).

**Case 1: \( a = b = c \):**

Substitute \( a = b = c \) into the inequality:

\[
a \frac{a^2+a^2}{a^2+a^2} + a \frac{a^2+a^2}{a^2+a^2} + a \frac{a^2+a^2}{a^2+a^2} = 3a.
\]

The right-hand side becomes:

\[
3C(a + a + a) = 9Ca.
\]

Thus, the inequality becomes:

\[
3a \geq 9Ca.
\]

Dividing both sides by \( 3a \) (assuming \( a > 0 \)), we get:

\[
1 \geq 3C.
\]

This implies:

\[
C \leq \frac{1}{3}.
\]

**Case 2: Test \( C = \frac{1}{3} \):**

We need to verify if \( C = \frac{1}{3} \) satisfies the inequality for all positive \( a, b, c \). The inequality becomes:

\[
\sum_{\text{cyc}} a \frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc} \geq a + b + c.
\]

This is equivalent to showing:

\[
a \frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc} + b \frac{c^2+a^2}{b^2+ca} + c \frac{a^2+b^2}{c^2+ab} \geq a + b + c.
\]

By AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[
\frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc} \geq \frac{2bc}{a^2+bc} \geq \frac{2bc}{2bc} = 1.
\]

Thus, each term \( a \frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc} \geq a \), and similarly for the other terms. Therefore, the inequality holds for \( C = \frac{1}{3} \).

Since \( C = \frac{1}{3} \) satisfies the inequality and is the largest possible value from our analysis, we conclude:

The answer is \( C = \frac{1}{3} \).
