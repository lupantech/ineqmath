## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given condition and the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.

Given that $ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, we know that opposite angles sum to $180^\circ$. The given condition is:

\[ AB \cdot BC = 2AD \cdot DC. \]

We need to determine the relationship between $8BD^2$ and $9AC^2$.

### Step 1: Use Ptolemy's Theorem

For a cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$, Ptolemy's Theorem states:

\[ AB \cdot CD + AD \cdot BC = AC \cdot BD. \]

### Step 2: Analyze the Given Condition

The condition $AB \cdot BC = 2AD \cdot DC$ can be rewritten as:

\[ AB \cdot BC - AD \cdot DC = AD \cdot DC. \]

### Step 3: Relate to Ptolemy's Theorem

From Ptolemy's Theorem, we have:

\[ AB \cdot CD + AD \cdot BC = AC \cdot BD. \]

We want to relate this to the given condition. Notice that:

\[ AB \cdot BC = 2AD \cdot DC \implies AB \cdot BC - AD \cdot DC = AD \cdot DC. \]

This suggests a relationship between the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$.

### Step 4: Consider the Inequality

We need to determine the relationship between $8BD^2$ and $9AC^2$. Let's assume:

\[ 8BD^2 \quad () \quad 9AC^2. \]

### Step 5: Use the Given Condition

The condition $AB \cdot BC = 2AD \cdot DC$ implies a specific balance in the quadrilateral. We can use this to infer the relationship between the diagonals.

### Step 6: Test the Options

Given the symmetry and the condition, let's test the options:

- If $8BD^2 = 9AC^2$, then $BD^2 = \frac{9}{8}AC^2$. This would imply a specific balance, but it doesn't directly follow from the given condition.
- If $8BD^2 < 9AC^2$, then $BD^2 < \frac{9}{8}AC^2$. This suggests $BD$ is relatively smaller compared to $AC$.
- If $8BD^2 > 9AC^2$, then $BD^2 > \frac{9}{8}AC^2$. This suggests $BD$ is relatively larger compared to $AC$.

### Step 7: Conclusion

Given the condition $AB \cdot BC = 2AD \cdot DC$, it suggests a specific balance that typically results in one diagonal being larger than the other. The condition implies that $BD$ is likely larger than $AC$ due to the factor of 2 in the condition.

Thus, the most reasonable conclusion is:

\[ 8BD^2 > 9AC^2. \]

Therefore, the correct inequality is:

The answer is (E) $>$.
