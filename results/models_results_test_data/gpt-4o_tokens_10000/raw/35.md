## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
d_a \cdot h_a^2 + d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \geq C \cdot (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3
\]

holds for all points \( P \) inside the triangle \( ABC \).

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry

The distances \( d_a, d_b, d_c \) are the perpendicular distances from the point \( P \) to the sides \( BC, CA, \) and \( AB \) respectively. The altitudes \( h_a, h_b, h_c \) are the perpendicular distances from the vertices \( A, B, C \) to the opposite sides.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Expression

The left-hand side of the inequality is a weighted sum of the distances \( d_a, d_b, d_c \) with weights \( h_a^2, h_b^2, h_c^2 \). The right-hand side is a cubic expression in the sum of the distances.

### Step 3: Special Case Analysis

Consider the case where \( P \) is the centroid of the triangle. In this case, the distances \( d_a, d_b, d_c \) are proportional to the areas of the sub-triangles \( PBC, PCA, PAB \), and their sum is constant, equal to the area of triangle \( ABC \).

### Step 4: Homogenization

The inequality is homogeneous of degree 3 in \( d_a, d_b, d_c \). We can assume without loss of generality that \( d_a + d_b + d_c = 1 \). Then the inequality becomes:

\[
d_a \cdot h_a^2 + d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \geq C
\]

### Step 5: Testing Extremes

Consider the case where \( P \) is very close to one of the vertices, say \( A \). In this case, \( d_a \approx 0 \), and \( d_b + d_c \approx 1 \). The left-hand side becomes approximately \( d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \), which is minimized when \( d_b = d_c = 0.5 \). The right-hand side becomes \( C \).

### Step 6: Using Known Results

A known result in geometry is that the sum of the distances from any interior point to the sides of a triangle is constant and equal to the area of the triangle divided by the semiperimeter. This suggests that the inequality should hold with equality when \( P \) is the centroid.

### Step 7: Calculating the Bound

For the centroid, the distances are \( d_a = d_b = d_c = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{\text{Area}}{s} \), where \( s \) is the semiperimeter. The left-hand side becomes:

\[
3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{\text{Area}}{s}\right) \cdot \frac{h_a^2 + h_b^2 + h_c^2}{3}
\]

The right-hand side becomes:

\[
C \cdot \left(3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{\text{Area}}{s}\right)^3
\]

Equating these and solving for \( C \), we find that the largest \( C \) is achieved when the inequality holds with equality for the centroid, leading to:

\[
C = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all points \( P \) inside the triangle is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

The answer is \( C = \frac{1}{4} \).
