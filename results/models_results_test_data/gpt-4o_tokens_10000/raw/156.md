## Response

To solve this problem, we need to compare the two expressions:

1. \( E_1 = a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + 2a + 2b + 2c + 3 \)
2. \( E_2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2a^2c + 2b^2a + 2c^2b \)

We will analyze these expressions to determine their relationship.

### Step 1: Simplify and Analyze \( E_1 \)

The expression \( E_1 = a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + 2a + 2b + 2c + 3 \) is a polynomial in \( a, b, c \) with degree 4. It includes linear terms \( 2a, 2b, 2c \) and a constant term 3.

### Step 2: Simplify and Analyze \( E_2 \)

The expression \( E_2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2a^2c + 2b^2a + 2c^2b \) is also a polynomial in \( a, b, c \) with degree 3. It includes quadratic terms \( a^2, b^2, c^2 \) and mixed terms \( 2a^2c, 2b^2a, 2c^2b \).

### Step 3: Compare the Degrees

The highest degree term in \( E_1 \) is \( a^4, b^4, c^4 \), which are degree 4 terms. In \( E_2 \), the highest degree terms are \( 2a^2c, 2b^2a, 2c^2b \), which are degree 3 terms. Therefore, for large values of \( a, b, c \), \( E_1 \) will dominate \( E_2 \) because the degree of \( E_1 \) is higher.

### Step 4: Consider Special Cases

Let's consider some special cases to further understand the relationship:

- **Case 1: \( a = b = c = 0 \)**
  - \( E_1 = 0^4 + 0^4 + 0^4 + 2(0) + 2(0) + 2(0) + 3 = 3 \)
  - \( E_2 = 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 2(0)^2(0) + 2(0)^2(0) + 2(0)^2(0) = 0 \)
  - Here, \( E_1 > E_2 \).

- **Case 2: \( a = b = c = 1 \)**
  - \( E_1 = 1^4 + 1^4 + 1^4 + 2(1) + 2(1) + 2(1) + 3 = 3 + 6 + 3 = 12 \)
  - \( E_2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1)^2(1) + 2(1)^2(1) + 2(1)^2(1) = 3 + 6 = 9 \)
  - Here, \( E_1 > E_2 \).

- **Case 3: \( a = b = c = -1 \)**
  - \( E_1 = (-1)^4 + (-1)^4 + (-1)^4 + 2(-1) + 2(-1) + 2(-1) + 3 = 3 - 6 + 3 = 0 \)
  - \( E_2 = (-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + 2(-1)^2(-1) + 2(-1)^2(-1) + 2(-1)^2(-1) = 3 - 6 = -3 \)
  - Here, \( E_1 > E_2 \).

### Conclusion

In all tested cases, \( E_1 > E_2 \). Given that \( E_1 \) has a higher degree than \( E_2 \), it will generally be greater for large values of \( a, b, c \). Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:

The answer is (E) $>$.
