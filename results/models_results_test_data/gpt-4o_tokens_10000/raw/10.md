## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{a^2}{\sqrt{(1+a^3)(1+b^3)}} + \frac{b^2}{\sqrt{(1+b^3)(1+c^3)}} + \frac{c^2}{\sqrt{(1+c^3)(1+a^3)}} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) with \( abc = 8 \).

### Step 1: Simplify the Problem

First, consider the symmetry and the condition \( abc = 8 \). A natural choice is to set \( a = b = c = 2 \), which satisfies \( abc = 8 \).

Substituting \( a = b = c = 2 \) into the inequality, we have:

\[
\frac{2^2}{\sqrt{(1+2^3)(1+2^3)}} + \frac{2^2}{\sqrt{(1+2^3)(1+2^3)}} + \frac{2^2}{\sqrt{(1+2^3)(1+2^3)}}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3 \times \frac{4}{\sqrt{(1+8)(1+8)}} = 3 \times \frac{4}{\sqrt{9 \times 9}} = 3 \times \frac{4}{9} = \frac{12}{9} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, for \( a = b = c = 2 \), the expression evaluates to \( \frac{4}{3} \).

### Step 2: Prove the Inequality

To show that \( \frac{4}{3} \) is indeed the largest possible value of \( C \), we need to prove that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) with \( abc = 8 \).

Using the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[
\sqrt{(1+a^3)(1+b^3)} \leq \frac{(1+a^3) + (1+b^3)}{2} = \frac{2 + a^3 + b^3}{2}
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{a^2}{\sqrt{(1+a^3)(1+b^3)}} \geq \frac{2a^2}{2 + a^3 + b^3}
\]

Similarly, we have:

\[
\frac{b^2}{\sqrt{(1+b^3)(1+c^3)}} \geq \frac{2b^2}{2 + b^3 + c^3}
\]

\[
\frac{c^2}{\sqrt{(1+c^3)(1+a^3)}} \geq \frac{2c^2}{2 + c^3 + a^3}
\]

Adding these inequalities, we get:

\[
\sum_{\text{cyc}} \frac{a^2}{\sqrt{(1+a^3)(1+b^3)}} \geq \sum_{\text{cyc}} \frac{2a^2}{2 + a^3 + b^3}
\]

### Step 3: Use AM-GM on the Denominator

By AM-GM, \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \geq 3\sqrt[3]{a^3b^3c^3} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \).

Thus, \( 2 + a^3 + b^3 \geq 8 \), and similarly for the other terms.

Therefore,

\[
\sum_{\text{cyc}} \frac{2a^2}{2 + a^3 + b^3} \geq \sum_{\text{cyc}} \frac{2a^2}{8} = \sum_{\text{cyc}} \frac{a^2}{4}
\]

Since \( abc = 8 \), by AM-GM, \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{a^2b^2c^2} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \).

Thus,

\[
\sum_{\text{cyc}} \frac{a^2}{4} \geq \frac{12}{4} = 3
\]

This shows that the inequality holds for all \( a, b, c > 0 \) with \( abc = 8 \).

### Conclusion

The largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) with \( abc = 8 \) is \( \frac{4}{3} \).

The answer is \( C = \frac{4}{3} \).
