    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality \\(\\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) \\geq C\\) holds for all sequences \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\) satisfying the conditions:\n\n1. \\(a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n \\geq n\\)\n2. \\(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\cdots + a_n^2 \\geq n^2\\)\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the conditions\n\nThe first condition implies that the average of the numbers is at least 1:\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n}{n} \\geq 1\n\\]\n\nThe second condition implies that the average of the squares is at least \\(n\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\cdots + a_n^2}{n} \\geq n\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality\n\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states:\n\\[\n(n \\cdot (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\cdots + a_n^2)) \\geq (a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n)^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given conditions:\n\\[\nn \\cdot n^2 \\geq (a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n)^2\n\\]\n\\[\nn^3 \\geq (a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n)^2\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n \\geq n\\), we have:\n\\[\nn^3 \\geq n^2 \\implies n \\geq n\n\\]\n\nThis inequality is trivially true, so it doesn't provide new information.\n\n### Step 3: Consider extreme cases\n\nTo find the largest possible value of \\(\\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)\\), consider the case where one of the numbers is much larger than the others. Assume \\(a_1 = a_2 = \\cdots = a_{n-1} = 1\\) and \\(a_n\\) is large.\n\n1. From the first condition:\n   \\[\n   (n-1) \\cdot 1 + a_n \\geq n \\implies a_n \\geq 1\n   \\]\n\n2.

From the above, we have:\n\\[\n\\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) = a_n \\geq \\sqrt{n^2 - n + 1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest constant \\(C\\) such that \\(\\max(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) \\geq C\\) for all sequences satisfying the conditions is:\n\\[\nC = \\sqrt{n^2 - n + 1}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{C = \\sqrt{n^2 - n + 1}}\\).",
