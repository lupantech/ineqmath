## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
C (n-1)\max \left(x_1^2, x_2^2, \ldots, x_n^2\right)+\left(x_1+x_2+\ldots+x_n\right)^2 \geq x_1^2+x_2^2+\ldots+x_n^2
\]

holds for all real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \).

### Step 1: Analyze the inequality

The inequality can be rewritten as:

\[
C (n-1) \max(x_1^2, x_2^2, \ldots, x_n^2) + \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\right)^2 \geq \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2
\]

### Step 2: Consider the case where all \( x_i \) are equal

Suppose \( x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n = x \). Then:

- \(\max(x_1^2, x_2^2, \ldots, x_n^2) = x^2\)
- \(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = nx\)
- \(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 = nx^2\)

Substituting these into the inequality gives:

\[
C(n-1)x^2 + (nx)^2 \geq nx^2
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
C(n-1)x^2 + n^2x^2 \geq nx^2
\]

\[
(C(n-1) + n^2)x^2 \geq nx^2
\]

Dividing both sides by \( x^2 \) (assuming \( x \neq 0 \)):

\[
C(n-1) + n^2 \geq n
\]

\[
C(n-1) \geq n - n^2
\]

\[
C \geq \frac{n - n^2}{n-1}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the expression for \( C \)

The expression \(\frac{n - n^2}{n-1}\) simplifies as follows:

\[
\frac{n - n^2}{n-1} = \frac{n(1-n)}{n-1} = \frac{-n(n-1)}{n-1} = -n
\]

Thus, \( C \geq -n \).

### Step 4: Consider the case where one \( x_i \) is much larger than the others

Suppose \( x_1 = x \) and \( x_2 = x_3 = \cdots = x_n = 0 \). Then:

- \(\max(x_1^2, x_2^2, \ldots, x_n^2) = x^2\)
- \(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = x\)
- \(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 = x^2\)

Substituting these into the inequality gives:

\[
C(n-1)x^2 + x^2 \geq x^2
\]

This inequality is trivially satisfied for any \( C \).

### Conclusion

The minimal value of \( C \) that satisfies both cases is \( C = -n \). Therefore, the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) is:

\[
\boxed{-n}
\]

The answer is \( C = -n \).
