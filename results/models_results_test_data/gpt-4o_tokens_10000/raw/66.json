    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the configuration of the isosceles triangle \\(\\triangle ABC\\) with \\(\\overline{AB} = \\overline{AC}\\) and the tangents to its circumcircle at points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry:**\n   - Let \\(O\\) be the circumcenter of \\(\\triangle ABC\\).\n   - The tangents at \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) intersect at point \\(D\\).\n   - Since \\(DA\\) and \\(DB\\) are tangents to the circumcircle, we have \\(\\angle DAB = \\angle DBA = 90^\\circ - \\angle BAC\\).\n\n2. **Analyzing \\(\\angle DCB\\):**\n   - We need to find \\(\\angle DCB\\).\n   - Note that \\(\\angle DCB\\) is an external angle to \\(\\triangle ABC\\) at vertex \\(C\\).\n   - By the external angle theorem, \\(\\angle DCB = \\angle DAB + \\angle ABC\\).\n\n3. **Expressing \\(\\angle DCB\\) in terms of \\(\\angle BAC\\):**\n   - Since \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is isosceles with \\(\\overline{AB} = \\overline{AC}\\), we have \\(\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB\\).\n   - Let \\(\\angle BAC = \\alpha\\). Then \\(\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB = \\frac{180^\\circ - \\alpha}{2}\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(\\angle DAB = 90^\\circ - \\alpha\\).\n   - Thus, \\(\\angle DCB = \\angle DAB + \\angle ABC = (90^\\circ - \\alpha) + \\frac{180^\\circ - \\alpha}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Simplifying the Expression:**\n   - \\(\\angle DCB = 90^\\circ - \\alpha + \\frac{180^\\circ - \\alpha}{2}\\).\n   - Simplifying further:\n     \\[\n     \\angle DCB = 90^\\circ - \\alpha + 90^\\circ - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = 180^\\circ - \\frac{3\\alpha}{2}.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Maximum of \\(\\angle DCB\\):**\n   - To find the maximum value of \\(\\angle DCB\\), we need to minimize \\(\\frac{3\\alpha}{2}\\).\n   - The minimum value of \\(\\alpha\\) is \\(0^\\circ\\) (as \\(\\alpha\\) approaches \\(0^\\circ\\), \\(\\triangle ABC\\) becomes degenerate).\n   - Therefore, the maximum value of \\(\\angle DCB\\) is when \\(\\alpha = 0^\\circ\\):\n     \\[\n     \\angle DCB = 180^\\circ - \\frac{3 \\times 0^\\circ}{2} = 180^\\circ.\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The inequality \\(\\angle DCB \\leq C\\) holds for all such triangles if \\(C = 180^\\circ\\).\n\nThus, the minimal constant \\(C\\) such that the inequality holds for all such triangles is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The answer is } C = 180^\\circ.\n\\]",
