## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the inequality:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{x}{7+z^3+y^3} \quad () \quad \frac{1}{2}.
\]

We are given that \(1 \geq x, y, z \geq 0\). Let's consider the expression:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{x}{7+z^3+y^3} = \frac{x}{7+z^3+y^3} + \frac{y}{7+x^3+z^3} + \frac{z}{7+y^3+x^3}.
\]

We need to determine the relationship between this sum and \(\frac{1}{2}\).

### Step 1: Analyze the Denominators

Each term in the sum has a denominator of the form \(7 + z^3 + y^3\). Since \(0 \leq z, y \leq 1\), we have:

\[
0 \leq z^3, y^3 \leq 1.
\]

Thus, the minimum value of each denominator is:

\[
7 + 0 + 0 = 7,
\]

and the maximum value is:

\[
7 + 1 + 1 = 9.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Numerators

Each numerator is \(x, y, z\) respectively, and since \(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 1\), each numerator is at most 1.

### Step 3: Estimate Each Term

Each term \(\frac{x}{7+z^3+y^3}\) is at most:

\[
\frac{1}{7}.
\]

Thus, the sum of the three terms is at most:

\[
3 \times \frac{1}{7} = \frac{3}{7}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with \(\frac{1}{2}\)

We have:

\[
\frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286 < 0.5 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Therefore, the sum \(\sum_{cyc} \frac{x}{7+z^3+y^3}\) is always less than \(\frac{1}{2}\).

### Conclusion

The correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

\[
\sum_{cyc} \frac{x}{7+z^3+y^3} < \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Thus, the answer is:

\[
\text{The answer is (D) } <.
