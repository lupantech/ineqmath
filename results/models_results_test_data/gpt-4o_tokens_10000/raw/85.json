    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality\n\n\\[\nx^2 + \\frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)} \\geq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all real numbers \\( x \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the expression\n\nThe expression consists of two parts: \\( x^2 \\) and \\(\\frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)}\\).\n\n- The term \\( x^2 \\) is non-negative and increases as \\( |x| \\) increases.\n- The term \\(\\frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)}\\) is positive and decreases as \\( |x-2| \\) increases.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the behavior of the expression at \\( x = 2 \\)\n\nAt \\( x = 2 \\), the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + \\frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)} = 2^2 + \\frac{1}{6(1+0)} = 4 + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{25}{6}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Consider the behavior as \\( x \\to \\infty \\) and \\( x \\to -\\infty \\)\n\nAs \\( x \\to \\infty \\) or \\( x \\to -\\infty \\), the term \\( x^2 \\) dominates, and the expression tends to infinity. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is not at infinity.\n\n### Step 4: Consider the behavior around \\( x = 2 \\)\n\nSince the expression is continuous and differentiable, we can check for local minima around \\( x = 2 \\).\n\nDefine the function:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{6(1+|x-2|)}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( x \\geq 2 \\), \\( |x-2| = x-2 \\), so:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{6(1+x-2)} = x^2 + \\frac{1}{6x-6}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( x < 2 \\), \\( |x-2| = 2-x \\), so:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{6(1+2-x)} = x^2 + \\frac{1}{8-x}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Check for local minima\n\n**For \\( x \\geq 2 \\):**\n\nThe derivative of \\( f(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{6x-6} \\) is:\n\n\\[\nf'(x) = 2x - \\frac{1}{(6x-6)^2}\n\\]\n\nSetting \\( f'(x) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n2x = \\frac{1}{(6x-6)^2}\n\\]\n\nThis equation is complex to solve analytically, but we know \\( f(x) \\) is increasing for \\( x > 2 \\) because \\( x^2 \\) grows faster than the decrease in \\(\\frac{1}{6x-6}\\).\n\n**For \\( x < 2 \\):**\n\nThe derivative of \\( f(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{8-x} \\) is:\n\n\\[\nf'(x) = 2x + \\frac{1}{(8-x)^2}\n\\]\n\nSetting \\( f'(x) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n2x = -\\frac{1}{(8-x)^2}\n\\]\n\nThis equation is also complex to solve analytically, but \\( f(x) \\) is increasing for \\( x < 2 \\) because \\( x^2 \\) grows faster than the decrease in \\(\\frac{1}{8-x}\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe minimum value of the expression occurs at \\( x = 2 \\), where we calculated:\n\n\\[\nf(2) = \\frac{25}{6}\n\\]\n\nThus, the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality holds for all \\( x \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{25}{6}}\n\\]\n\nThe answer is \\( C = \\frac{25}{6} \\).",
