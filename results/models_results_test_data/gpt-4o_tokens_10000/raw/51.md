## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality \(\max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) \geq C\) holds for all sequences \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) satisfying the conditions:

1. \(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n \geq n\)
2. \(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2 \geq n^2\)

### Step 1: Analyze the conditions

The first condition implies that the average of the numbers is at least 1:
\[
\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n} \geq 1
\]

The second condition implies that the average of the squares is at least \(n\):
\[
\frac{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2}{n} \geq n
\]

### Step 2: Use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states:
\[
(n \cdot (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2)) \geq (a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)^2
\]

Substituting the given conditions:
\[
n \cdot n^2 \geq (a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)^2
\]
\[
n^3 \geq (a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n)^2
\]

Since \(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n \geq n\), we have:
\[
n^3 \geq n^2 \implies n \geq n
\]

This inequality is trivially true, so it doesn't provide new information.

### Step 3: Consider extreme cases

To find the largest possible value of \(\max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)\), consider the case where one of the numbers is much larger than the others. Assume \(a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_{n-1} = 1\) and \(a_n\) is large.

1. From the first condition:
   \[
   (n-1) \cdot 1 + a_n \geq n \implies a_n \geq 1
   \]

2. From the second condition:
   \[
   (n-1) \cdot 1^2 + a_n^2 \geq n^2 \implies n-1 + a_n^2 \geq n^2
   \]
   \[
   a_n^2 \geq n^2 - (n-1) = n^2 - n + 1
   \]

To find the minimum value of \(a_n\) that satisfies this inequality, solve:
\[
a_n \geq \sqrt{n^2 - n + 1}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the largest \(C\)

The largest value of \(\max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)\) is achieved when \(a_n\) is maximized. From the above, we have:
\[
\max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) = a_n \geq \sqrt{n^2 - n + 1}
\]

Thus, the largest constant \(C\) such that \(\max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) \geq C\) for all sequences satisfying the conditions is:
\[
C = \sqrt{n^2 - n + 1}
\]

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{C = \sqrt{n^2 - n + 1}}\).
