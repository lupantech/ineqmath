## Response

To solve this problem, we need to compare the expression \(\sum a \frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc}\) with \(\sum a\), where \(a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}_{+}\).

Let's first expand the expression \(\sum a \frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc}\):

\[
\sum a \frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc} = a \frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc} + b \frac{c^2+a^2}{b^2+ca} + c \frac{a^2+b^2}{c^2+ab}.
\]

We want to compare this with \(\sum a = a + b + c\).

To gain insight, let's analyze each term individually. Consider the term \(a \frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc}\):

\[
a \frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc} = \frac{a(b^2+c^2)}{a^2+bc}.
\]

We want to determine if this is less than, equal to, or greater than \(a\). This boils down to comparing:

\[
\frac{a(b^2+c^2)}{a^2+bc} \quad \text{with} \quad a.
\]

This is equivalent to checking:

\[
\frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc} \quad \text{with} \quad 1.
\]

Thus, we need to determine if:

\[
b^2 + c^2 \leq a^2 + bc.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
b^2 + c^2 - bc \leq a^2.
\]

This inequality is not generally true for all positive \(a, b, c\). For example, if \(a = b = c\), then:

\[
b^2 + c^2 - bc = 2b^2 - b^2 = b^2,
\]

and

\[
a^2 = b^2,
\]

so the inequality holds as an equality. However, for other values, such as \(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3\), we have:

\[
b^2 + c^2 - bc = 4 + 9 - 6 = 7,
\]

and

\[
a^2 = 1,
\]

which does not satisfy the inequality. Therefore, the inequality \(b^2 + c^2 \leq a^2 + bc\) is not always true.

Thus, the expression \(\sum a \frac{b^2+c^2}{a^2+bc}\) is not always less than or equal to \(\sum a\). In fact, it can be greater than \(\sum a\) for certain values of \(a, b, c\).

Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:

The answer is (B) \(\geq\).
