    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(a-b)^2}{(b-c)^2} + \\frac{(b-c)^2}{(c-a)^2} + \\frac{(c-a)^2}{(a-b)^2} \\geq C\n\\]\n\nholds for all real numbers \\( a, b, c \\).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the expression:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(a-b)^2}{(b-c)^2}, \\quad y = \\frac{(b-c)^2}{(c-a)^2}, \\quad z = \\frac{(c-a)^2}{(a-b)^2}\n\\]\n\nWe have the product:\n\n\\[\nxyz = \\frac{(a-b)^2}{(b-c)^2} \\cdot \\frac{(b-c)^2}{(c-a)^2} \\cdot \\frac{(c-a)^2}{(a-b)^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nThe inequality becomes:\n\n\\[\nx + y + z \\geq C\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( xyz = 1 \\), we can apply the AM-GM inequality:\n\n\\[\nx + y + z \\geq 3\\sqrt[3]{xyz} = 3\\sqrt[3]{1} = 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression \\( x + y + z \\) is always at least 3. Therefore, the largest constant \\( C \\) for which the inequality holds for all real numbers \\( a, b, c \\) is 3.\n\nTo verify that \\( C = 3 \\) is achievable, consider the case when \\( a = b = c \\). In this scenario, the expression is undefined due to division by zero, so we consider a limit approach. Let \\( a = t, b = t + \\epsilon, c = t + 2\\epsilon \\) and take the limit as \\( \\epsilon \\to 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{\\epsilon^2} = 1, \\quad y = \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{\\epsilon^2} = 1, \\quad z = \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{\\epsilon^2} = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( x + y + z = 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the inequality holds with equality when \\( a = b = c \\), confirming that the largest constant \\( C \\) is indeed 3.\n\nThe answer is \\( C = 3 \\).",
