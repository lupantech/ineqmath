## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} + \frac{a_2}{a_3} + \cdots + \frac{a_n}{a_1} \leq Cn - 1
\]

holds for any sequence \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) of real numbers greater than 1, with the condition \(|a_k - a_{k+1}| \leq 1\) for \(1 \leq k \leq n-1\).

### Step 1: Analyze the Expression

Consider the expression:

\[
S = \frac{a_1}{a_2} + \frac{a_2}{a_3} + \cdots + \frac{a_n}{a_1}.
\]

We want to bound \( S \) from above. Notice that each term \(\frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}}\) is close to 1 because \(|a_k - a_{k+1}| \leq 1\) and both \(a_k\) and \(a_{k+1}\) are greater than 1.

### Step 2: Simplify the Problem

Assume \(a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_n = a\). Then each term \(\frac{a_k}{a_{k+1}} = 1\), and thus:

\[
S = n.
\]

This gives us a baseline: \(S = n\) when all \(a_k\) are equal.

### Step 3: Consider Small Perturbations

Now, consider small perturbations around this equal case. Suppose \(a_1 = a, a_2 = a + \epsilon, a_3 = a, \ldots\), where \(\epsilon\) is small. Then:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{a}{a+\epsilon} \approx 1 - \frac{\epsilon}{a},
\]
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_3} = \frac{a+\epsilon}{a} \approx 1 + \frac{\epsilon}{a}.
\]

The terms approximately cancel each other out, and the sum remains close to \(n\).

### Step 4: Consider Extremal Cases

Consider the extremal case where \(a_1 = 2\), \(a_2 = 1\), \(a_3 = 2\), and so on, alternating between 2 and 1. Then:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = 2, \quad \frac{a_2}{a_3} = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \frac{a_3}{a_4} = 2, \quad \frac{a_4}{a_5} = \frac{1}{2}, \ldots
\]

For even \(n\), the sum is:

\[
S = n \cdot \left(\frac{2 + \frac{1}{2}}{2}\right) = \frac{5n}{4}.
\]

For odd \(n\), the sum is slightly less than \(\frac{5n}{4}\) due to the last term being \(\frac{1}{2}\).

### Step 5: Determine the Constant \(C\)

The worst-case scenario gives us \(S \approx \frac{5n}{4}\). Therefore, we need:

\[
\frac{5n}{4} \leq Cn - 1.
\]

Solving for \(C\), we get:

\[
Cn \geq \frac{5n}{4} + 1.
\]

Dividing by \(n\), we find:

\[
C \geq \frac{5}{4} + \frac{1}{n}.
\]

As \(n\) becomes large, \(\frac{1}{n}\) becomes negligible, so the smallest \(C\) that satisfies the inequality for all \(n\) is:

\[
C = \frac{5}{4}.
\]

Thus, the smallest constant \(C\) is \(\frac{5}{4}\).

The answer is \(\boxed{C = \frac{5}{4}}\).
