Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
(a+b)(c+a)^2 \geq C a b c
\]

holds for all real numbers \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( 0 < a \leq b \leq c \).

### Step 1: Analyze the inequality

The inequality can be rewritten as:

\[
(a+b)(c+a)^2 = (a+b)(c^2 + 2ac + a^2)
\]

Expanding this, we have:

\[
= (a+b)c^2 + 2(a+b)ac + (a+b)a^2
\]

\[
= ac^2 + bc^2 + 2a^2c + 2abc + a^3 + a^2b
\]

We need this to be greater than or equal to \( C a b c \).

### Step 2: Consider special cases

#### Case 1: \( a = b = c \)

If \( a = b = c \), the inequality becomes:

\[
(2a)(2a)^2 = 8a^3 \geq C a^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8 \geq C
\]

#### Case 2: \( a = b \) and \( c \to \infty \)

If \( a = b \) and \( c \to \infty \), the inequality becomes:

\[
(2a)(c+a)^2 \geq C a^2 c
\]

For large \( c \), the dominant term on the left is \( 2ac^2 \), so:

\[
2ac^2 \geq C a^2 c
\]

Dividing both sides by \( ac \) (assuming \( a, c > 0 \)) gives:

\[
2c \geq C a
\]

As \( c \to \infty \), this implies \( C \leq 0 \), which is not possible since \( C \) must be positive.

#### Case 3: \( a \to 0^+ \)

If \( a \to 0^+ \), the inequality becomes:

\[
(b)(c)^2 \geq C \cdot 0 \cdot b \cdot c = 0
\]

This is trivially true for any \( C \).

### Step 3: Consider \( a = b \) and \( c = ka \) for \( k \geq 1 \)

Let \( b = a \) and \( c = ka \) where \( k \geq 1 \). The inequality becomes:

\[
(2a)((ka) + a)^2 = (2a)(ka + a)^2 = (2a)((k+1)a)^2
\]

\[
= 2a(k+1)^2a^2 = 2(k+1)^2a^3
\]

We need:

\[
2(k+1)^2a^3 \geq C a^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2(k+1)^2 \geq C
\]

For \( k = 1 \), we have:

\[
2(1+1)^2 = 8 \geq C
\]

### Conclusion

From the analysis, the largest value of \( C \) that satisfies all cases is \( C = 8 \).

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{8}\).

The answer is \( C = 8 \).
