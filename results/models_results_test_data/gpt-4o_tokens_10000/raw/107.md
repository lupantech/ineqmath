## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given inequality and the condition \(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} = 2\) with \(x, y, z > 1\).

First, let's rewrite the condition:
\[
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} = 2.
\]
This implies that the reciprocals of \(x, y, z\) sum to 2, which suggests that \(x, y, z\) are relatively small numbers greater than 1.

Now, consider the inequality:
\[
\sqrt{2x + 3y + z} \quad () \quad \sqrt{x-1} + \sqrt{y-1} + \sqrt{z-1}.
\]

To gain insight, let's explore the behavior of both sides of the inequality for small values of \(x, y, z\) that satisfy the condition. 

### Step 1: Analyze the left side
The left side is:
\[
\sqrt{2x + 3y + z}.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the right side
The right side is:
\[
\sqrt{x-1} + \sqrt{y-1} + \sqrt{z-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Consider a specific case
Let's try specific values that satisfy the condition \(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} = 2\).

#### Example: \(x = 2, y = 2, z = 2\)
For these values:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \neq 2.
\]
This doesn't satisfy the condition, so let's try another set.

#### Example: \(x = 2, y = 3, z = 6\)
For these values:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = 1.
\]
This also doesn't satisfy the condition. Let's try another set.

#### Example: \(x = 3, y = 3, z = 3\)
For these values:
\[
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 1.
\]
This doesn't satisfy the condition either.

#### Example: \(x = 2, y = 2, z = 4\)
For these values:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1.25.
\]
This doesn't satisfy the condition.
