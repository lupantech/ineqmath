Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
a + \frac{1}{b(a-b)} \geq C
\]

holds for all non-negative real numbers \( a \) and \( b \) with \( a \geq b \geq 0 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the expression

The expression involves \( a \) and \( b \) in the form \( a + \frac{1}{b(a-b)} \). We need to ensure that this expression is well-defined. The term \( \frac{1}{b(a-b)} \) is undefined when \( b(a-b) = 0 \). This occurs in two cases:
- \( b = 0 \)
- \( a = b \)

### Step 2: Consider the case \( b = 0 \)

If \( b = 0 \), the expression simplifies to:

\[
a + \frac{1}{0 \cdot (a-0)} = a + \text{undefined}
\]

This suggests that the expression is not well-defined when \( b = 0 \). However, if we consider the limit as \( b \to 0^+ \), we have:

\[
a + \frac{1}{b(a-b)} \to a + \frac{1}{0} = \infty
\]

Thus, for \( b \) approaching zero, the expression tends to infinity, which does not provide a bound for \( C \).

### Step 3: Consider the case \( a = b \)

If \( a = b \), the expression becomes:

\[
a + \frac{1}{b(a-b)} = a + \frac{1}{b \cdot 0} = a + \text{undefined}
\]

Again, the expression is not well-defined. However, if we consider the limit as \( a \to b^+ \), we have:

\[
a + \frac{1}{b(a-b)} \to b + \frac{1}{b \cdot 0^+} = b + \infty = \infty
\]

Thus, for \( a \) approaching \( b \), the expression also tends to infinity.

### Step 4: Consider \( a > b > 0 \)

For \( a > b > 0 \), the expression is well-defined. We need to find the minimum value of:

\[
a + \frac{1}{b(a-b)}
\]

Given \( a \geq b > 0 \), let's try to find a lower bound. Consider the case when \( a = b + \epsilon \) for a small positive \( \epsilon \). Then:

\[
a + \frac{1}{b(a-b)} = (b + \epsilon) + \frac{1}{b\epsilon}
\]

As \( \epsilon \to 0^+ \), the term \( \frac{1}{b\epsilon} \to \infty \), so the expression tends to infinity.

### Step 5: Find the minimum value for specific \( a \) and \( b \)

To find a specific lower bound, consider \( a = 2b \). Then:

\[
a + \frac{1}{b(a-b)} = 2b + \frac{1}{b(b)} = 2b + \frac{1}{b^2}
\]

For \( b = 1 \), this becomes:

\[
2 \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{1^2} = 2 + 1 = 3
\]

Thus, the expression can be as small as 3 for specific values of \( a \) and \( b \).

### Conclusion

The smallest value that the expression can take, considering all cases, is 3. Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a \geq b \geq 0 \) is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]

The answer is \( C = 3 \).
