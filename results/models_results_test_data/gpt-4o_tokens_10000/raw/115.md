## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given condition and the inequality involving \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

We are given that:
\[
\sum \frac{1}{1+a^2} = \frac{1}{1+a^2} + \frac{1}{1+b^2} + \frac{1}{1+c^2} = 2.
\]

We need to determine the relationship between:
\[
a b c(a+b+c-2a b c) \quad () \quad \frac{3}{2}.
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the given condition

The condition \(\sum \frac{1}{1+a^2} = 2\) implies that the sum of the fractions is quite large, given that each term \(\frac{1}{1+a^2}\) is less than or equal to 1. This suggests that each \(a^2\), \(b^2\), and \(c^2\) must be relatively small, as larger values would decrease the value of each fraction.

### Step 2: Consider the implications

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive real numbers, and each \(\frac{1}{1+a^2}\) is close to 1, it suggests that \(a^2\), \(b^2\), and \(c^2\) are close to 0. This implies that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are close to 0.

### Step 3: Simplify the inequality

We need to evaluate:
\[
a b c(a+b+c-2a b c).
\]

Given that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are small, the product \(a b c\) is very small. The expression \(a+b+c\) is also small, and \(2a b c\) is even smaller. Therefore, the term \(a+b+c-2a b c\) is approximately equal to \(a+b+c\).

Thus, the expression \(a b c(a+b+c-2a b c)\) is approximately:
\[
a b c \cdot (a+b+c) \approx a b c \cdot a + a b c \cdot b + a b c \cdot c = a^2 b c + a b^2 c + a b c^2.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with \(\frac{3}{2}\)

Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are small, the terms \(a^2 b c\), \(a b^2 c\), and \(a b c^2\) are all very small, making the entire expression \(a b c(a+b+c-2a b c)\) very small.

Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that:
\[
a b c(a+b+c-2a b c) < \frac{3}{2}.
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:
\[
a b c(a+b+c-2a b c) < \frac{3}{2}.
\]

The answer is (D) $<$.
