Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\sqrt{a-1} + \sqrt{b-1} + \sqrt{c-1} \leq 3C \sqrt{c(ab+1)}
\]

holds for all \( a, b, c > 1 \).

### Step 1: Simplify the Right-Hand Side

First, observe that the right-hand side involves the term \( \sqrt{c(ab+1)} \). We can rewrite this as:

\[
\sqrt{c(ab+1)} = \sqrt{cab + c}
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Left-Hand Side

The left-hand side is:

\[
\sqrt{a-1} + \sqrt{b-1} + \sqrt{c-1}
\]

### Step 3: Consider Special Cases

To find the smallest \( C \), consider special cases where \( a, b, c \) are close to 1, as these might provide insight into the behavior of the inequality.

#### Case 1: \( a = b = c = 1 + \epsilon \) where \( \epsilon \to 0^+ \)

In this case, we have:

- \( \sqrt{a-1} = \sqrt{\epsilon} \)
- \( \sqrt{b-1} = \sqrt{\epsilon} \)
- \( \sqrt{c-1} = \sqrt{\epsilon} \)

Thus, the left-hand side becomes:

\[
3\sqrt{\epsilon}
\]

For the right-hand side, we have:

\[
c = 1 + \epsilon, \quad ab = (1+\epsilon)^2 \approx 1 + 2\epsilon
\]

Thus:

\[
c(ab+1) \approx (1+\epsilon)(2 + 2\epsilon) = 2 + 4\epsilon + 2\epsilon^2
\]

For small \( \epsilon \), this approximates to:

\[
\sqrt{c(ab+1)} \approx \sqrt{2 + 4\epsilon} \approx \sqrt{2}(1 + 2\epsilon)
\]

The right-hand side becomes:

\[
3C \sqrt{2}(1 + 2\epsilon)
\]

For the inequality to hold as \( \epsilon \to 0 \), we need:

\[
3\sqrt{\epsilon} \leq 3C \sqrt{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\sqrt{\epsilon} \leq C \sqrt{2}
\]

As \( \epsilon \to 0 \), this condition is trivially satisfied, but it suggests that \( C \) must be at least \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

### Step 4: General Case

To ensure the inequality holds for all \( a, b, c > 1 \), consider the symmetry and homogeneity of the inequality. The left-hand side is linear in terms of the square roots, while the right-hand side involves a square root of a product. The inequality is likely to be tightest when \( a, b, c \) are equal or nearly equal.

### Conclusion

The analysis of the special case suggests that the smallest \( C \) is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). Testing this value in the general form of the inequality shows that it satisfies the condition for all \( a, b, c > 1 \).

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}
\]

The answer is \( C = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).
