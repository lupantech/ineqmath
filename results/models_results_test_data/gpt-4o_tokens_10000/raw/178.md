## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given expression:

\[
S = \frac{x_1}{1+x_1^2} + \frac{x_2}{1+x_1^2+x_2^2} + \ldots + \frac{x_n}{1+x_1^2+\ldots+x_n^2}
\]

and compare it to \(\sqrt{n}\).

### Step 1: Analyze Each Term

Each term in the sum is of the form:

\[
\frac{x_k}{1 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_k^2}
\]

For each \(k\), the denominator \(1 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_k^2\) is at least 1, since it includes the term 1. Therefore, each term is bounded by:

\[
\left| \frac{x_k}{1 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_k^2} \right| \leq \left| x_k \right|
\]

### Step 2: Consider the Sum

The sum \(S\) is:

\[
S = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{x_k}{1 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_k^2}
\]

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:

\[
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{x_k}{1 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_k^2} \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{x_k^2}{(1 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_k^2)^2} \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n 1 \right)
\]

The second sum is simply \(n\), so:

\[
S^2 \leq n \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{x_k^2}{(1 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_k^2)^2}
\]

### Step 3: Compare to \(\sqrt{n}\)

To compare \(S\) to \(\sqrt{n}\), consider the case where all \(x_k = 0\). Then:

\[
S = 0
\]

and \(\sqrt{n} > 0\). Thus, \(S < \sqrt{n}\) in this case.

### Step 4: General Case

For arbitrary \(x_k\), note that each term \(\frac{x_k}{1 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_k^2}\) is bounded by \(|x_k|\), and the sum of absolute values \(|x_1| + |x_2| + \ldots + |x_n|\) is generally less than or equal to \(\sqrt{n(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_n^2)}\) by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. However, the denominator in each term grows, making each term smaller.

Thus, the sum \(S\) is generally less than \(\sqrt{n}\).

### Conclusion

The inequality that holds for all real numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) is:

\[
S < \sqrt{n}
\]

Therefore, the correct option is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
