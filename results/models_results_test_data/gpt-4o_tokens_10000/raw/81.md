Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{a}{1+b^2 c}+\frac{b}{1+c^2 d}+\frac{c}{1+d^2 a}+\frac{d}{1+a^2 b} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c, d \) satisfying \( a+b+c+d=4 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Expression

First, observe that each term in the sum is of the form \(\frac{x}{1+y^2 z}\). To understand the behavior of this expression, consider the case when \( y \) and \( z \) are small. The denominator \( 1 + y^2 z \) approaches 1, making the fraction approximately \( x \).

### Step 2: Consider Symmetric Case

A natural approach is to consider the symmetric case where \( a = b = c = d = 1 \). In this case, the constraint \( a+b+c+d=4 \) is satisfied, and each term becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1+1^2 \cdot 1} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the sum is:

\[
4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2
\]

This suggests that \( C \leq 2 \).

### Step 3: Prove \( C = 2 \) is Achievable

To show that \( C = 2 \) is achievable, we need to prove that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c, d \) such that \( a+b+c+d=4 \).

Using the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[
b^2 c \geq 0 \implies 1 + b^2 c \geq 1
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a}{1+b^2 c} \geq \frac{a}{1}
\]

Similarly, for the other terms:

\[
\frac{b}{1+c^2 d} \geq \frac{b}{1}, \quad \frac{c}{1+d^2 a} \geq \frac{c}{1}, \quad \frac{d}{1+a^2 b} \geq \frac{d}{1}
\]

Adding these inequalities gives:

\[
\frac{a}{1+b^2 c} + \frac{b}{1+c^2 d} + \frac{c}{1+d^2 a} + \frac{d}{1+a^2 b} \geq a + b + c + d = 4
\]

This shows that the inequality holds with \( C = 2 \) for the symmetric case. However, we need to ensure that \( C = 2 \) is the largest possible value.

### Step 4: Verify \( C = 2 \) is the Largest

To verify that \( C = 2 \) is indeed the largest possible value, consider the case where one of the variables approaches 4 and the others approach 0. For instance, let \( a = 4 - \epsilon \) and \( b = c = d = \frac{\epsilon}{3} \) for small \(\epsilon > 0\). Then:

\[
\frac{a}{1+b^2 c} \approx \frac{4-\epsilon}{1} = 4-\epsilon
\]

The other terms become negligible as \(\epsilon \to 0\). Thus, the sum approaches 4, confirming that \( C = 2 \) is the largest value that satisfies the inequality for all cases.

Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c, d \) with \( a+b+c+d=4 \) is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]

The answer is \( C = 2 \).
