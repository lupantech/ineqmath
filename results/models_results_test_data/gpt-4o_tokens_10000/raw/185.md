## Response

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and the inequality:

1. **Given Condition**: 
   \[
   a^2 b^2 (a^2 + b^2 + 2) \geq 4
   \]

2. **Inequality to Analyze**:
   \[
   (a+2b)(1+2ab) \quad () \quad 5
   \]

We need to determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Step 1: Simplify the Given Condition**

The condition is:
\[
a^2 b^2 (a^2 + b^2 + 2) \geq 4
\]

This implies that the product of \(a^2 b^2\) and the sum \(a^2 + b^2 + 2\) is at least 4. This condition suggests that either \(a\) or \(b\) (or both) must be non-zero, as if both were zero, the left-hand side would be zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.

**Step 2: Analyze the Expression \((a+2b)(1+2ab)\)**

We need to determine the relationship between \((a+2b)(1+2ab)\) and 5.

- **Case 1**: \(a = 0\)

  If \(a = 0\), the condition becomes:
  \[
  0 \cdot b^2 (0 + b^2 + 2) = 0 \geq 4
  \]
  This is false, so \(a\) cannot be zero.

- **Case 2**: \(b = 0\)

  If \(b = 0\), the condition becomes:
  \[
  a^2 \cdot 0 \cdot (a^2 + 0 + 2) = 0 \geq 4
  \]
  This is also false, so \(b\) cannot be zero.

Thus, both \(a\) and \(b\) must be positive.

**Step 3: Consider the Expression \((a+2b)(1+2ab)\)**

Let's expand the expression:
\[
(a+2b)(1+2ab) = a + 2b + 2a^2b + 4ab^2
\]

We need to compare this with 5.

**Step 4: Use the Given Condition**

The condition \(a^2 b^2 (a^2 + b^2 + 2) \geq 4\) implies that \(a^2 b^2\) is not too small. Let's test some simple values to see if we can find a pattern or a specific case that satisfies the condition and helps us determine the inequality.

- **Example**: Let \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\).

  - Check the condition:
    \[
    1^2 \cdot 1^2 \cdot (1^2 + 1^2 + 2) = 1 \cdot 4 = 4 \geq 4
    \]
    The condition is satisfied.

  - Evaluate the expression:
    \[
    (1 + 2 \cdot 1)(1 + 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1) = 3 \cdot 3 = 9
    \]

  Here, \(9 > 5\).

This suggests that the expression \((a+2b)(1+2ab)\) is greater than 5 for \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), which satisfies the condition. 

**Conclusion**: Based on the example and the analysis, the expression \((a+2b)(1+2ab)\) is likely to be greater than 5 when the condition is satisfied.

The answer is \((E) >\).
