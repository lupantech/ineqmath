\frac{a^3}{b^2}+\frac{b^3}{c^2}+\frac{c^3}{a^2} \geq C\left(\frac{a^2}{4b}+\frac{b^2}{4c}+\frac{c^2}{4a}\right)

Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{a^3}{b^2} + \frac{b^3}{c^2} + \frac{c^3}{a^2} \geq C \left( \frac{a^2}{4b} + \frac{b^2}{4c} + \frac{c^2}{4a} \right)
\]

holds for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \).

### Step 1: Simplify the Inequality

First, let's rewrite the inequality in a more manageable form:

\[
\frac{a^3}{b^2} + \frac{b^3}{c^2} + \frac{c^3}{a^2} \geq \frac{C}{4} \left( \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{a} \right)
\]

### Step 2: Test with Symmetric Case

Consider the symmetric case where \( a = b = c \). Substituting \( a = b = c \) into the inequality gives:

\[
3a \geq \frac{C}{4} \cdot 3a
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
3a \geq \frac{3Ca}{4}
\]

Dividing both sides by \( 3a \) (since \( a > 0 \)), we get:

\[
1 \geq \frac{C}{4}
\]

Thus, \( C \leq 4 \).

### Step 3: Check if \( C = 4 \) Works

Now, we need to verify if \( C = 4 \) satisfies the inequality for all positive \( a, b, c \). Substituting \( C = 4 \) into the inequality, we have:

\[
\frac{a^3}{b^2} + \frac{b^3}{c^2} + \frac{c^3}{a^2} \geq \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{a}
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{a^3}{b^2} - \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^3}{c^2} - \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^3}{a^2} - \frac{c^2}{a} \geq 0
\]

### Step 4: Analyze Each Term

Consider each term separately:

- For the term \(\frac{a^3}{b^2} - \frac{a^2}{b}\), factor it as:

  \[
  \frac{a^2}{b^2}(a - b)
  \]

- Similarly, for \(\frac{b^3}{c^2} - \frac{b^2}{c}\), factor it as:

  \[
  \frac{b^2}{c^2}(b - c)
  \]

- And for \(\frac{c^3}{a^2} - \frac{c^2}{a}\), factor it as:

  \[
  \frac{c^2}{a^2}(c - a)
  \]

### Step 5: Apply AM-GM Inequality

Using the AM-GM inequality, we can show that each of these terms is non-negative. For example:

\[
\frac{a^3}{b^2} - \frac{a^2}{b} = \frac{a^2}{b^2}(a - b) \geq 0 \quad \text{if} \quad a \geq b
\]

Similarly, the other terms are non-negative under their respective conditions. Therefore, the entire expression is non-negative.

### Conclusion

Since the inequality holds for \( C = 4 \) and \( C \leq 4 \) from the symmetric case, the largest constant \( C \) is indeed 4.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{C=4}\).
