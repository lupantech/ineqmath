## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{a}{3a-b+c} + \frac{b}{3b-c+a} + \frac{c}{3c-a+b} \geq C
\]

holds for all side lengths \( a, b, c \) of a triangle. The side lengths must satisfy the triangle inequalities:

1. \( a + b > c \)
2. \( b + c > a \)
3. \( c + a > b \)

### Step 1: Analyze the Expression

First, observe the structure of the terms in the inequality. Each term in the sum has the form:

\[
\frac{x}{3x-y+z}
\]

where \( x, y, z \) are permutations of \( a, b, c \). The denominator \( 3x-y+z \) is always positive due to the triangle inequalities. For example, for the term \(\frac{a}{3a-b+c}\), we have:

- \( 3a-b+c > 0 \) because \( 3a > b-c \), which is true since \( a + b > c \).

### Step 2: Consider Special Cases

To find the largest possible \( C \), consider special cases where the inequality might be tight.

#### Case 1: Equilateral Triangle

Let \( a = b = c \). Then each term becomes:

\[
\frac{a}{3a-a+a} = \frac{a}{3a} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Thus, the sum is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 1
\]

This suggests \( C \leq 1 \).

#### Case 2: Degenerate Triangle

Consider the case where the triangle is nearly degenerate, such as \( a = b \) and \( c \to 0 \). Then:

- \(\frac{a}{3a-b+c} = \frac{a}{2a} = \frac{1}{2}\)
- \(\frac{b}{3b-c+a} = \frac{a}{2a} = \frac{1}{2}\)
- \(\frac{c}{3c-a+b} \to 0\)

The sum approaches:

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + 0 = 1
\]

This again suggests \( C \leq 1 \).

### Step 3: Prove \( C = 1 \) is Achievable

We have shown that in both the equilateral and nearly degenerate cases, the sum is exactly 1. To prove that \( C = 1 \) is achievable for all triangles, consider the inequality:

\[
\frac{a}{3a-b+c} + \frac{b}{3b-c+a} + \frac{c}{3c-a+b} \geq 1
\]

By the AM-GM inequality, each term is non-negative, and the sum of the terms in the equilateral case is exactly 1. Therefore, the inequality holds for all valid triangles.

### Conclusion

The largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all triangles is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]

Thus, the answer is \( C = 1 \).
