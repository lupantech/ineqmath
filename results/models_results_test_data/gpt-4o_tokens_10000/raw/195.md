## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given expression and determine the correct inequality relation. We are given:

\[
\frac{2}{a} + \frac{4}{b} + \frac{2}{c} + (2ab + 3bc + 3ca)
\]

and we need to compare it to 10, given that \(a + b + c = 3\) and \(a, b, c\) are positive real numbers.

### Step 1: Simplify and Analyze the Expression

First, let's consider the expression:

\[
\frac{2}{a} + \frac{4}{b} + \frac{2}{c}
\]

Using the AM-GM inequality, we know:

\[
\frac{2}{a} + \frac{4}{b} + \frac{2}{c} \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{2}{a} \cdot \frac{4}{b} \cdot \frac{2}{c}} = 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{16}{abc}}
\]

### Step 2: Consider the Second Part of the Expression

Now, consider the second part:

\[
2ab + 3bc + 3ca
\]

We will use the fact that \(a + b + c = 3\) to find a bound for this expression. By AM-GM:

\[
ab + bc + ca \leq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{3} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
\]

Thus:

\[
2ab + 3bc + 3ca \leq 2 \cdot 3 = 6
\]

### Step 3: Combine the Results

Now, let's combine the results from the two parts:

\[
\frac{2}{a} + \frac{4}{b} + \frac{2}{c} + (2ab + 3bc + 3ca) \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{16}{abc}} + 6
\]

We need to check if this expression is always greater than or equal to 10. 

### Step 4: Test for Equality

To check if equality can be achieved, consider the case when \(a = b = c = 1\). Then:

\[
\frac{2}{1} + \frac{4}{1} + \frac{2}{1} + (2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 1) = 2 + 4 + 2 + (2 + 3 + 3) = 10
\]

Thus, the expression equals 10 when \(a = b = c = 1\).

### Conclusion

Since the expression can equal 10 and is generally greater than or equal to 10, the correct inequality is:

\[
\frac{2}{a} + \frac{4}{b} + \frac{2}{c} + (2ab + 3bc + 3ca) \geq 10
\]

The answer is \((B) \geq\).
