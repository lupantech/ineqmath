Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{a b c(a b+a c+b c)^2}{\left(a^2+b^2+c^2\right)^2} \geq 2C(a+b-c)(a+c-b)(b+c-a)
\]

holds for all positive numbers \( a, b, c \).

### Step 1: Analyze the inequality

The inequality involves symmetric expressions in \( a, b, c \). The right-hand side, \( (a+b-c)(a+c-b)(b+c-a) \), is positive if and only if \( a, b, c \) can form the sides of a triangle. This suggests that the inequality is most interesting when \( a, b, c \) are the sides of a triangle.

### Step 2: Consider the case when \( a = b = c \)

If \( a = b = c \), then the inequality becomes:

\[
\frac{a^3(3a^2)^2}{(3a^2)^2} \geq 2C(3a-2a)(3a-2a)(3a-2a)
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
\frac{27a^5}{9a^4} \geq 2C(a^3)
\]

\[
3a \geq 2Ca^3
\]

\[
3 \geq 2Ca^2
\]

\[
C \leq \frac{3}{2a^2}
\]

As \( a \to 0 \), this bound becomes very large, so this case does not provide a useful bound for \( C \).

### Step 3: Consider the case when \( a, b, c \) form a degenerate triangle

Suppose \( a = b = c \). Then the inequality becomes:

\[
\frac{a^3(3a^2)^2}{(3a^2)^2} \geq 2C(0)
\]

This is trivially true for any \( C \).

### Step 4: Consider the case when \( a, b, c \) are the sides of a non-degenerate triangle

For a non-degenerate triangle, we use Heron's formula for the area \( \Delta \):

\[
\Delta = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]

where \( s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} \). The expression \( (a+b-c)(a+c-b)(b+c-a) \) is related to \( 16\Delta^2 \).

### Step 5: Use the AM-GM inequality

Using the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{3}
\]

Thus,

\[
(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 \geq \frac{(a+b+c)^4}{9}
\]

### Step 6: Simplify and find \( C \)

To find the largest \( C \), we need to consider the equality case of the AM-GM inequality, which occurs when \( a = b = c \). In this case, the inequality becomes:

\[
\frac{27a^5}{9a^4} \geq 2C(a^3)
\]

\[
3a \geq 2Ca^3
\]

\[
3 \geq 2Ca^2
\]

\[
C \leq \frac{3}{2a^2}
\]

As \( a \to 1 \), this gives \( C \leq \frac{3}{2} \).

### Conclusion

The largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}
\]

Thus, the answer is \( C = \frac{1}{2} \).
