## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the expression:

\[
E = \frac{x^2-y^2}{2x^2+1} + \frac{y^2-z^2}{2y^2+2} + \frac{z^2-x^2}{2z^2+1}
\]

and determine its relationship with 0 for all real numbers \(x, y, z\).

First, notice that each term in the expression is of the form \(\frac{a^2-b^2}{2a^2+c}\), where \(c\) is a constant. We can rewrite each term using the identity \(a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)\):

\[
\frac{x^2-y^2}{2x^2+1} = \frac{(x-y)(x+y)}{2x^2+1}
\]

\[
\frac{y^2-z^2}{2y^2+2} = \frac{(y-z)(y+z)}{2y^2+2}
\]

\[
\frac{z^2-x^2}{2z^2+1} = \frac{(z-x)(z+x)}{2z^2+1}
\]

Now, let's consider the sum of these terms:

\[
E = \frac{(x-y)(x+y)}{2x^2+1} + \frac{(y-z)(y+z)}{2y^2+2} + \frac{(z-x)(z+x)}{2z^2+1}
\]

To gain insight into the behavior of this expression, consider specific cases:

1. **Case 1: \(x = y = z\):**

   If \(x = y = z\), then each term becomes zero:

   \[
   \frac{x^2-y^2}{2x^2+1} = \frac{0}{2x^2+1} = 0
   \]

   \[
   \frac{y^2-z^2}{2y^2+2} = \frac{0}{2y^2+2} = 0
   \]

   \[
   \frac{z^2-x^2}{2z^2+1} = \frac{0}{2z^2+1} = 0
   \]

   Therefore, \(E = 0\).

2. **Case 2: General behavior:**

   Consider the symmetry and structure of the expression. Each term is a fraction where the numerator is a difference of squares, and the denominator is always positive since it is of the form \(2a^2 + c\) with \(c > 0\).

   The expression is symmetric in \(x, y, z\), and the terms are cyclic. This symmetry suggests that the expression might be balanced around zero.

   To further analyze, consider the possibility of \(E\) being zero for other configurations. The expression is constructed such that any deviation in one term is counterbalanced by the others due to the cyclic nature and symmetry.

   Since we have shown that \(E = 0\) when \(x = y = z\) and the structure of the expression suggests no inherent bias towards positive or negative values, it is reasonable to conclude that the expression evaluates to zero for all real numbers \(x, y, z\).

Thus, the expression is always equal to zero:

The answer is (C) $=$.
