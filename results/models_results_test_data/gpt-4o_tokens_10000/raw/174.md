## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given inequality involving the sides of a triangle \(a, b, c\) and the cosine of the angles opposite these sides. The inequality is:

\[
3(a b(1+2 \cos (c))+b c(1+2 \cos (a))+a c(1+2 \cos (b))) \quad () \quad 2\left(\sum_{cyc} \sqrt{\left(c^2+a b(1+2 \cos (c))\right)\left(b^2+a c(1+\cos (b))\right)}\right).
\]

### Step 1: Simplify the Left Side

The left side of the inequality is:

\[
3(a b(1+2 \cos (c))+b c(1+2 \cos (a))+a c(1+2 \cos (b))).
\]

This can be expanded as:

\[
3(ab + 2ab \cos(c) + bc + 2bc \cos(a) + ac + 2ac \cos(b)).
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Right Side

The right side of the inequality is:

\[
2\left(\sum_{cyc} \sqrt{\left(c^2+a b(1+2 \cos (c))\right)\left(b^2+a c(1+\cos (b))\right)}\right).
\]

This involves cyclic sums and square roots, which makes it complex to simplify directly. However, we can analyze the structure:

- Each term inside the square root is of the form \(\sqrt{(c^2 + ab(1+2\cos(c)))(b^2 + ac(1+\cos(b)))}\).

### Step 3: Analyze the Inequality

To determine the correct inequality, consider the properties of the triangle and the cosine rule:

- The cosine rule states: \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(C)\).
- Therefore, \(ab \cos(C) = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2}\).

Substituting this into the left side, we have:

\[
ab(1 + 2\cos(c)) = ab + 2\left(\frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2}\right) = ab + a^2 + b^2 - c^2.
\]

Similarly, for the other terms, we can express them in terms of \(a^2, b^2, c^2\).

### Step 4: Compare Both Sides

The left side simplifies to a linear combination of \(a^2, b^2, c^2\) and products of sides, while the right side involves square roots of similar expressions. The square root terms generally lead to a more complex expression that is typically larger than the linear terms due to the nature of the triangle inequality and the properties of square roots.

### Conclusion

Given the structure of the expressions and the properties of triangles, the left side is generally less than or equal to the right side. Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:

\[
3(a b(1+2 \cos (c))+b c(1+2 \cos (a))+a c(1+2 \cos (b))) \leq 2\left(\sum_{cyc} \sqrt{\left(c^2+a b(1+2 \cos (c))\right)\left(b^2+a c(1+\cos (b))\right)}\right).
\]

Thus, the answer is:

The answer is (A) \(\leq\).
