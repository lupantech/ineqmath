## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (ab + bc + ca) \geq C
\]

holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( a^2 + 2b + c^2 = 1 \).

First, let's express the inequality in terms of \( a^2, b, \) and \( c^2 \):

\[
2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (ab + bc + ca) = 2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2 - ab - bc - ca.
\]

We need to find the minimum value of this expression given the constraint \( a^2 + 2b + c^2 = 1 \).

### Step 1: Simplify the Expression

Consider the expression:

\[
2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2 - ab - bc - ca.
\]

We can rewrite it as:

\[
2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2 - ab - bc - ca = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - ab - bc - ca.
\]

### Step 2: Use the Constraint

Using the constraint \( a^2 + 2b + c^2 = 1 \), we have:

\[
a^2 + c^2 = 1 - 2b.
\]

Substitute this into the expression:

\[
(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = (1 - 2b) + b^2 = 1 - 2b + b^2.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
(1 - 2b + b^2) + (1 - 2b + b^2) - ab - bc - ca.
\]

Simplify:

\[
2(1 - 2b + b^2) - ab - bc - ca = 2 - 4b + 2b^2 - ab - bc - ca.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the Expression

To find the minimum value, consider specific cases:

- **Case 1**: \( a = 0, c = 0 \)

  Then \( a^2 + 2b + c^2 = 1 \) implies \( 2b = 1 \), so \( b = \frac{1}{2} \).

  Substitute into the expression:

  \[
  2(0^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 0^2) - (0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 0) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}.
  \]

- **Case 2**: \( a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 \)

  Then \( a^2 + 2b + c^2 = 1 \) is satisfied.

  Substitute into the expression:

  \[
  2(1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) - (1 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 1) = 2.
  \]

- **Case 3**: \( a = 0, b = 0, c = 1 \)

  Then \( a^2 + 2b + c^2 = 1 \) is satisfied.

  Substitute into the expression:

  \[
  2(0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) - (0 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0) = 2.
  \]

### Conclusion

The minimum value of the expression \( 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (ab + bc + ca) \) is \(\frac{1}{2}\), which occurs when \( a = 0, b = \frac{1}{2}, c = 0 \).

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( a, b, c \) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}
\]

The answer is \( C = \frac{1}{2} \).
