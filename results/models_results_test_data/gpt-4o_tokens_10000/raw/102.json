    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the semiperimeter \\( s \\) and the expression \\( 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2 \\) for an acute-angled triangle.\n\nFirst, let's recall some important relationships and inequalities involving the circumradius \\( R \\), inradius \\( r \\), and semiperimeter \\( s \\) of a triangle:\n\n1. **Euler's Inequality**: For any triangle, \\( R \\geq 2r \\).\n2. **Gerretsen's Inequality**: For any triangle, \\( s^2 \\leq 4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 \\).\n\nSince the triangle is acute-angled, we have additional properties:\n\n- For an acute-angled triangle, it is known that \\( s^2 < 4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the expression \\( 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2 \\) and compare it with \\( s^2 \\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Gerretsen's Inequality for Acute Triangles**:\n   \\[\n   s^2 < 4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Comparing \\( 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2 \\) with \\( 4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 \\)**:\n   - We have:\n     \\[\n     4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 = 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2 + 2R^2 - 4Rr\n     \\]\n   - This implies:\n     \\[\n     4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 = 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2 + (2R^2 - 4Rr)\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 > 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2\n     \\]\n   - This is because \\( 2R^2 - 4Rr > 0 \\) for an acute triangle, as \\( R > 2r \\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \\( s^2 < 4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 \\) and \\( 4R^2 + 4Rr + 3r^2 > 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2 \\), it follows that:\n     \\[\n     s^2 < 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2\n     \\]\n\nThus, the correct inequality relation is \\( s^2 < 2R^2 + 8Rr + 3r^2 \\).\n\nThe answer is (D) $<$.",
