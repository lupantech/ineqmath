## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{(a-b)^2}{(b-c)^2} + \frac{(b-c)^2}{(c-a)^2} + \frac{(c-a)^2}{(a-b)^2} \geq C
\]

holds for all real numbers \( a, b, c \).

First, let's analyze the expression:

\[
x = \frac{(a-b)^2}{(b-c)^2}, \quad y = \frac{(b-c)^2}{(c-a)^2}, \quad z = \frac{(c-a)^2}{(a-b)^2}
\]

We have the product:

\[
xyz = \frac{(a-b)^2}{(b-c)^2} \cdot \frac{(b-c)^2}{(c-a)^2} \cdot \frac{(c-a)^2}{(a-b)^2} = 1
\]

The inequality becomes:

\[
x + y + z \geq C
\]

Given that \( xyz = 1 \), we can apply the AM-GM inequality:

\[
x + y + z \geq 3\sqrt[3]{xyz} = 3\sqrt[3]{1} = 3
\]

Thus, the expression \( x + y + z \) is always at least 3. Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) for which the inequality holds for all real numbers \( a, b, c \) is 3.

To verify that \( C = 3 \) is achievable, consider the case when \( a = b = c \). In this scenario, the expression is undefined due to division by zero, so we consider a limit approach. Let \( a = t, b = t + \epsilon, c = t + 2\epsilon \) and take the limit as \( \epsilon \to 0 \):

\[
x = \frac{\epsilon^2}{\epsilon^2} = 1, \quad y = \frac{\epsilon^2}{\epsilon^2} = 1, \quad z = \frac{\epsilon^2}{\epsilon^2} = 1
\]

Thus, \( x + y + z = 3 \).

Therefore, the inequality holds with equality when \( a = b = c \), confirming that the largest constant \( C \) is indeed 3.

The answer is \( C = 3 \).
