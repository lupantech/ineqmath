    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometry of the given configuration and find the largest constant \\( C \\) such that the inequality \\( OD \\cdot OE \\cdot OF \\geq C R^3 \\) holds for all acute triangles \\( ABC \\).\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Configuration:**\n   - \\( O \\) is the circumcenter of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n   - \\( D \\) is the intersection of \\( AO \\) with the circumcircle of triangle \\( OBC \\).\n   - \\( E \\) is the intersection of \\( BO \\) with the circumcircle of triangle \\( OCA \\).\n   - \\( F \\) is the intersection of \\( CO \\) with the circumcircle of triangle \\( OAB \\).\n\n2. **Properties of the Configuration:**\n   - Since \\( D \\) lies on the circumcircle of \\( OBC \\), by the power of a point, we have \\( OD \\cdot OA = OB \\cdot OC \\).\n   - Similarly, \\( OE \\cdot OB = OC \\cdot OA \\) and \\( OF \\cdot OC = OA \\cdot OB \\).\n\n3. **Product of Distances:**\n   - Multiply the three power of point equations:\n     \\[\n     (OD \\cdot OA) \\cdot (OE \\cdot OB) \\cdot (OF \\cdot OC) = (OB \\cdot OC) \\cdot (OC \\cdot OA) \\cdot (OA \\cdot OB).\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     OD \\cdot OE \\cdot OF \\cdot (OA \\cdot OB \\cdot OC) = (OA \\cdot OB \\cdot OC)^2.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     OD \\cdot OE \\cdot OF = OA \\cdot OB \\cdot OC.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Relating to the Circumradius \\( R \\):**\n   - In an acute triangle, the circumradius \\( R \\) is related to the distances \\( OA, OB, \\) and \\( OC \\) as follows:\n     \\[\n     OA = OB = OC = R.\n     \\]\n   - Thus:\n     \\[\n     OD \\cdot OE \\cdot OF = R \\cdot R \\cdot R = R^3.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Largest Constant \\( C \\):**\n   - From the above, we have shown that \\( OD \\cdot OE \\cdot OF = R^3 \\).\n   - Therefore, the inequality \\( OD \\cdot OE \\cdot OF \\geq C R^3 \\) holds with equality when \\( C = 1 \\).\n   - Hence, the largest constant \\( C \\) for which the inequality holds for all acute triangles is \\( C = 1 \\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).\n\nThe answer is \\( C = 1 \\).",
