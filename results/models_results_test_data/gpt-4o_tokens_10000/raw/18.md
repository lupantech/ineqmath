Problem: Let $m, n$ be natural numbers. Find the smallest constant $C$ such that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$, the following inequality holds:

Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\sin^{2m} x \cdot \cos^{2n} y \leq C \frac{3m^n n^n}{(m+n)^{m+n}}
\]

holds for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Left-Hand Side

The expression \(\sin^{2m} x \cdot \cos^{2n} y\) is maximized when \(\sin^{2m} x = 1\) and \(\cos^{2n} y = 1\). This occurs when \(x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi\) for integers \(k\) and \(y = k\pi\) for integers \(k\). Thus, the maximum value of \(\sin^{2m} x \cdot \cos^{2n} y\) is 1.

### Step 2: Analyze the Right-Hand Side

The right-hand side of the inequality is:

\[
C \frac{3m^n n^n}{(m+n)^{m+n}}
\]

We need this to be at least 1 for the inequality to hold for all \(x\) and \(y\), especially when the left-hand side is maximized (i.e., equals 1).

### Step 3: Determine the Smallest \( C \)

To ensure the inequality holds, we set:

\[
1 \leq C \frac{3m^n n^n}{(m+n)^{m+n}}
\]

Solving for \( C \), we get:

\[
C \geq \frac{(m+n)^{m+n}}{3m^n n^n}
\]

Thus, the smallest possible value for \( C \) is:

\[
C = \frac{(m+n)^{m+n}}{3m^n n^n}
\]

### Conclusion

The smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{(m+n)^{m+n}}{3m^n n^n}}
\]

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{C = \frac{(m+n)^{m+n}}{3m^n n^n}}\).
