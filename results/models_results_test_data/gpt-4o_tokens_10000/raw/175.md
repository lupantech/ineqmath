## Response

To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct inequality relation between the expressions \(9abc + 3\) and \(7(ab + bc + ca)\) given that \(a, b, c > 0\) and \(a + b + c = 1\).

First, let's analyze the expressions:

1. **Expression 1:** \(9abc + 3\)
2. **Expression 2:** \(7(ab + bc + ca)\)

We need to compare these two expressions under the constraint \(a + b + c = 1\).

### Step 1: Use Symmetric Properties

Since \(a, b, c\) are symmetric in the expressions, we can assume without loss of generality that \(a \leq b \leq c\). However, to simplify the analysis, let's consider the case where \(a = b = c\). This is a common technique to test symmetric inequalities.

If \(a = b = c\), then \(a + b + c = 3a = 1\), so \(a = b = c = \frac{1}{3}\).

Substitute \(a = b = c = \frac{1}{3}\) into the expressions:

- **Expression 1:** 
  \[
  9abc + 3 = 9 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 + 3 = 9 \cdot \frac{1}{27} + 3 = \frac{1}{3} + 3 = \frac{10}{3}
  \]

- **Expression 2:**
  \[
  7(ab + bc + ca) = 7 \left(3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2\right) = 7 \cdot 3 \cdot \frac{1}{9} = 7 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{3}
  \]

### Step 2: Compare the Values

For \(a = b = c = \frac{1}{3}\), we have:
- \(9abc + 3 = \frac{10}{3}\)
- \(7(ab + bc + ca) = \frac{7}{3}\)

Clearly, \(\frac{10}{3} > \frac{7}{3}\).

### Step 3: General Case

To ensure this holds generally, consider the AM-GM inequality and other symmetric properties. The AM-GM inequality states:
\[
ab + bc + ca \leq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Thus, \(7(ab + bc + ca) \leq \frac{7}{3}\).

For \(9abc\), by AM-GM:
\[
abc \leq \left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{27}
\]
Thus, \(9abc \leq \frac{1}{3}\).

Adding 3 to both sides gives:
\[
9abc + 3 \leq \frac{1}{3} + 3 = \frac{10}{3}
\]

Since \(7(ab + bc + ca) \leq \frac{7}{3}\), and we found \(9abc + 3 = \frac{10}{3}\) when \(a = b = c = \frac{1}{3}\), it suggests that generally \(9abc + 3 \geq 7(ab + bc + ca)\).

### Conclusion

The inequality \(9abc + 3 \geq 7(ab + bc + ca)\) holds for \(a, b, c > 0\) with \(a + b + c = 1\).

The answer is (B) \(\geq\).
