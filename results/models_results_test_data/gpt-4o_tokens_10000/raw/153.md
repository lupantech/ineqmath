## Response

To solve this problem, we need to compare the two expressions:

1. \( a^4(a^2 + bc) + b^4(b^2 + ac) + c^4(c^2 + ab) \)
2. \( a^5(2b + c) + b^5(a + 3c) + c^5(5a + b) \)

Let's analyze each term in both expressions.

### Expression 1:
- The term \( a^4(a^2 + bc) = a^6 + a^4bc \).
- The term \( b^4(b^2 + ac) = b^6 + b^4ac \).
- The term \( c^4(c^2 + ab) = c^6 + c^4ab \).

Thus, Expression 1 simplifies to:
\[ a^6 + b^6 + c^6 + a^4bc + b^4ac + c^4ab. \]

### Expression 2:
- The term \( a^5(2b + c) = 2a^5b + a^5c \).
- The term \( b^5(a + 3c) = b^5a + 3b^5c \).
- The term \( c^5(5a + b) = 5c^5a + c^5b \).

Thus, Expression 2 simplifies to:
\[ 2a^5b + a^5c + b^5a + 3b^5c + 5c^5a + c^5b. \]

### Comparison:
To compare these expressions, consider the symmetry and the degree of each term. Both expressions are homogeneous of degree 6, meaning each term in both expressions has a total degree of 6 when considering the powers of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

#### Symmetry and Inequality:
- Expression 1 has terms like \( a^6 \), \( b^6 \), \( c^6 \), which are pure powers and tend to dominate when one variable is much larger than the others.
- Expression 2 has mixed terms like \( 2a^5b \), \( 3b^5c \), \( 5c^5a \), which are more significant when two variables are large compared to the third.

To determine the inequality, consider specific cases:

1. **Case \( a = b = c \):**
   - Expression 1: \( 3a^6 + 3a^6 = 6a^6 \).
   - Expression 2: \( 6a^6 \).

   Both expressions are equal when \( a = b = c \).

2. **Case \( a = 1, b = 1, c = 0 \):**
   - Expression 1: \( 1^6 + 1^6 + 0 = 2 \).
   - Expression 2: \( 2 \times 1^5 \times 1 + 1^5 \times 0 = 2 \).

   Both expressions are equal.

3. **Case \( a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 \):**
   - Expression 1: \( 1^6 = 1 \).
   - Expression 2: \( 0 \).

   Expression 1 is greater.

4. **Case \( a = 0, b = 1, c = 0 \):**
   - Expression 1: \( 1^6 = 1 \).
   - Expression 2: \( 0 \).

   Expression 1 is greater.

5. **Case \( a = 0, b = 0, c = 1 \):**
   - Expression 1: \( 1^6 = 1 \).
   - Expression 2: \( 0 \).

   Expression 1 is greater.

From these cases, we observe that Expression 1 is generally greater than or equal to Expression 2, and they are equal in symmetric cases like \( a = b = c \).

Thus, the correct inequality relation is:

The answer is (B) \(\geq\).
