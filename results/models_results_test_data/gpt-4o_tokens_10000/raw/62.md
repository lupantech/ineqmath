## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{x y z}{(1+3x)(x+8y)(y+9z)(z+6)} \leq C
\]

holds for all positive \( x, y, z \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Denominator

The denominator of the fraction is:

\[
(1+3x)(x+8y)(y+9z)(z+6).
\]

Each factor in the denominator is a linear function of one of the variables, with positive coefficients. This suggests that the denominator grows quite rapidly as any of the variables increase.

### Step 2: Consider the Behavior as Variables Approach Zero

To find the minimal \( C \), consider the behavior of the expression as \( x, y, z \to 0^+ \). In this case, the denominator approaches:

\[
(1+3 \cdot 0)(0+8 \cdot 0)(0+9 \cdot 0)(0+6) = 1 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 \cdot 6 = 0.
\]

However, since \( x, y, z > 0 \), we should consider small positive values. Let's analyze the expression when \( x, y, z \) are very small but positive.

### Step 3: Simplify the Expression for Small Values

For small \( x, y, z \), the denominator can be approximated as:

\[
(1+3x) \approx 1, \quad (x+8y) \approx 8y, \quad (y+9z) \approx 9z, \quad (z+6) \approx 6.
\]

Thus, the denominator is approximately:

\[
1 \cdot 8y \cdot 9z \cdot 6 = 432yz.
\]

The numerator is \( xyz \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{xyz}{432yz} = \frac{x}{432}.
\]

As \( x \to 0^+ \), this expression approaches 0, which suggests that the inequality holds for very small values of \( x, y, z \).

### Step 4: Consider the Behavior as Variables Increase

Now consider the case where one of the variables is large, say \( x \to \infty \). The denominator becomes:

\[
(1+3x)(x+8y)(y+9z)(z+6) \approx 3x \cdot x \cdot y \cdot z = 3x^2yz.
\]

The numerator is \( xyz \), so the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{xyz}{3x^2yz} = \frac{1}{3x}.
\]

As \( x \to \infty \), this expression approaches 0, which again suggests that the inequality holds.

### Step 5: Find the Maximum Value

To find the maximum value of the expression, consider setting \( x = y = z = 1 \):

\[
\frac{1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}{(1+3 \cdot 1)(1+8 \cdot 1)(1+9 \cdot 1)(1+6)} = \frac{1}{4 \cdot 9 \cdot 10 \cdot 7} = \frac{1}{2520}.
\]

This is a candidate for the maximum value of the expression.

### Conclusion

The maximum value of the expression, when \( x = y = z = 1 \), is \(\frac{1}{2520}\). Therefore, the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( x, y, z \) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{2520}}
\]

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{C = \frac{1}{2520}}\).
