## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given inequality and determine the correct relation between the two sides. We are given that \( x, y, z > 0 \) and \( x + y + z = xyz \). We need to compare:

\[
\frac{x+y}{1+2z^2} + \frac{y+z}{1+2x^2} + \frac{z+x}{1+y^2} \quad () \quad \frac{27}{2xyz}.
\]

First, let's explore the condition \( x + y + z = xyz \). This condition is often associated with the substitution \( x = \frac{a+b}{c}, y = \frac{b+c}{a}, z = \frac{c+a}{b} \) for some positive \( a, b, c \). This substitution satisfies the condition because:

\[
x + y + z = \frac{a+b}{c} + \frac{b+c}{a} + \frac{c+a}{b} = \frac{(a+b)b + (b+c)c + (c+a)a}{abc} = \frac{ab + ac + bc + ab + bc + ca}{abc} = \frac{2(ab + bc + ca)}{abc}.
\]

And:

\[
xyz = \frac{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)}{abc}.
\]

Expanding the product:

\[
(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = a(b+c)(c+a) + b(b+c)(c+a) = abc + aca + bcb + bca + cba + ccb.
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
= abc + ac^2 + b^2c + bca + cba + c^2b = abc + ac^2 + b^2c + 2bca + c^2b.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
= abc + ac^2 + b^2c + 2bca + c^2b = abc + ac^2 + b^2c + 2bca + c^2b.
\]

Now, let's consider the inequality:

\[
\frac{x+y}{1+2z^2} + \frac{y+z}{1+2x^2} + \frac{z+x}{1+y^2} \quad () \quad \frac{27}{2xyz}.
\]

To analyze this, we can use the AM-GM inequality and other inequalities to compare the two sides. However, a more straightforward approach is to test specific values that satisfy \( x + y + z = xyz \).

Let's test \( x = y = z = 3 \). Then:

\[
x + y + z = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9,
\]
\[
xyz = 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27.
\]

Thus, the condition \( x + y + z = xyz \) holds.

Now, compute each term:

\[
\frac{x+y}{1+2z^2} = \frac{6}{1 + 2 \times 9} = \frac{6}{19},
\]
\[
\frac{y+z}{1+2x^2} = \frac{6}{1 + 2 \times 9} = \frac{6}{19},
\]
\[
\frac{z+x}{1+y^2} = \frac{6}{1 + 9} = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}.
\]

Summing these:

\[
\frac{6}{19} + \frac{6}{19} + \frac{3}{5} = \frac{12}{19} + \frac{3}{5}.
\]

Finding a common denominator:

\[
\frac{12}{19} + \frac{3}{5} = \frac{12 \times 5 + 3 \times 19}{95} = \frac{60 + 57}{95} = \frac{117}{95}.
\]

Now, compute the right side:

\[
\frac{27}{2xyz} = \frac{27}{2 \times 27} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Comparing \(\frac{117}{95}\) and \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
\frac{117}{95} \approx 1.2316, \quad \frac{1}{2} = 0.5.
\]

Clearly, \(\frac{117}{95} > \frac{1}{2}\).

Thus, the inequality is:

\[
\frac{x+y}{1+2z^2} + \frac{y+z}{1+2x^2} + \frac{z+x}{1+y^2} > \frac{27}{2xyz}.
\]

The answer is (E) $>$.
