## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given expression and determine its relationship with \(\frac{7}{3}\).

The expression is:

\[
S = \frac{a+b}{5a+b+2c} + \frac{b+c}{b+c+3a} + \frac{c+a}{c+4a+2b} + \frac{2(ab+bc+ca)}{3a^2+2b^2+c^2}
\]

We need to determine whether \(S\) is less than, greater than, or equal to \(\frac{7}{3}\).

### Step 1: Analyze Each Term

1. **First Term: \(\frac{a+b}{5a+b+2c}\)**

   - The numerator \(a+b\) is always less than or equal to the denominator \(5a+b+2c\) because \(5a+b+2c\) includes all terms of \(a+b\) plus additional positive terms.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{a+b}{5a+b+2c} \leq 1\).

2. **Second Term: \(\frac{b+c}{b+c+3a}\)**

   - Similarly, \(b+c\) is less than or equal to \(b+c+3a\).
   - Thus, \(\frac{b+c}{b+c+3a} \leq 1\).

3. **Third Term: \(\frac{c+a}{c+4a+2b}\)**

   - Again, \(c+a\) is less than or equal to \(c+4a+2b\).
   - Hence, \(\frac{c+a}{c+4a+2b} \leq 1\).

4. **Fourth Term: \(\frac{2(ab+bc+ca)}{3a^2+2b^2+c^2}\)**

   - This term is more complex, but we can use the AM-GM inequality to estimate it.
   - By AM-GM, \(ab + bc + ca \leq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{3}\).
   - Also, \(3a^2 + 2b^2 + c^2 \geq a^2 + b^2 + c^2\).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{2(ab+bc+ca)}{3a^2+2b^2+c^2} \leq \frac{2 \cdot \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{3}}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = \frac{2(a+b+c)^2}{3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}\).

### Step 2: Combine and Compare

- Each of the first three terms is less than or equal to 1.
- The fourth term is more complex, but it is bounded by a function of \(a, b, c\).

To find a specific bound, consider the case when \(a = b = c = 1\):

- First term: \(\frac{1+1}{5 \cdot 1 + 1 + 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}\).
- Second term: \(\frac{1+1}{1+1+3 \cdot 1} = \frac{2}{5}\).
- Third term: \(\frac{1+1}{1+4 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{2}{7}\).
- Fourth term: \(\frac{2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1)}{3 \cdot 1^2 + 2 \cdot 1^2 + 1^2} = \frac{6}{6} = 1\).

Adding these:

\[
S = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{5} + \frac{2}{7} + 1
\]

Calculating:

- \(\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\)
- \(\frac{2}{5} = 0.4\)
- \(\frac{2}{7} \approx 0.2857\)
- Total: \(0.25 + 0.4 + 0.2857 + 1 = 1.9357\)

This is less than \(\frac{7}{3} \approx 2.3333\).

### Conclusion

The expression \(S\) is less than \(\frac{7}{3}\) for \(a = b = c = 1\), and by symmetry and the nature of the terms, it is reasonable to conclude that \(S < \frac{7}{3}\) for all positive \(a, b, c\).

Thus, the correct inequality relation is:

\[
\boxed{\text{The answer is (D) $<$}}
\]
