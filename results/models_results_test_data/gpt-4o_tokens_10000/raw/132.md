## Response

To solve this problem, we need to compare the arithmetic mean of \(a, b, c\) with the 27th root of the average of their cubes. Specifically, we need to determine the correct inequality relation between \(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\) and \(\sqrt[27]{\frac{a^3+b^3+c^3}{3}}\).

### Step 1: Analyze the Given Condition

We are given that \((a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 8\). This condition will be useful in our analysis, but first, let's focus on the inequality.

### Step 2: Apply the AM-GM Inequality

The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. Applying this to \(a, b, c\), we have:

\[
\frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc}
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the Expression \(\sqrt[27]{\frac{a^3+b^3+c^3}{3}}\)

We need to compare \(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\) with \(\sqrt[27]{\frac{a^3+b^3+c^3}{3}}\). Let's consider the expression \(\frac{a^3+b^3+c^3}{3}\).

By the Power Mean Inequality, for positive numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) and \(p > q\), we have:

\[
\left( \frac{x_1^p + x_2^p + \cdots + x_n^p}{n} \right)^{1/p} \geq \left( \frac{x_1^q + x_2^q + \cdots + x_n^q}{n} \right)^{1/q}
\]

Applying this to \(a, b, c\) with \(p = 3\) and \(q = 1\), we get:

\[
\left( \frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{3} \right)^{1/3} \geq \frac{a+b+c}{3}
\]

### Step 4: Relate the Two Inequalities

We have:

1. \(\frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc}\)
2. \(\left( \frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{3} \right)^{1/3} \geq \frac{a+b+c}{3}\)

From the second inequality, raising both sides to the power of 9 gives:

\[
\frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{3} \geq \left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right)^3
\]

Taking the 27th root of both sides:

\[
\sqrt[27]{\frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{3}} \geq \sqrt[27]{\left(\frac{a+b+c}{3}\right)^3} = \frac{a+b+c}{3}
\]

### Conclusion

The inequality \(\frac{a+b+c}{3} \leq \sqrt[27]{\frac{a^3+b^3+c^3}{3}}\) holds. Therefore, the correct inequality relation is \(\leq\).

The answer is (A) \(\leq\).
