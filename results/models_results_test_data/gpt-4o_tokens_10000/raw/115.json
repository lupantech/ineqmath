    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given condition and the inequality involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\nWe are given that:\n\\[\n\\sum \\frac{1}{1+a^2} = \\frac{1}{1+a^2} + \\frac{1}{1+b^2} + \\frac{1}{1+c^2} = 2.\n\\]\n\nWe need to determine the relationship between:\n\\[\na b c(a+b+c-2a b c) \\quad () \\quad \\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given condition\n\nThe condition \\(\\sum \\frac{1}{1+a^2} = 2\\) implies that the sum of the fractions is quite large, given that each term \\(\\frac{1}{1+a^2}\\) is less than or equal to 1. This suggests that each \\(a^2\\), \\(b^2\\), and \\(c^2\\) must be relatively small, as larger values would decrease the value of each fraction.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the implications\n\nSince \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are positive real numbers, and each \\(\\frac{1}{1+a^2}\\) is close to 1, it suggests that \\(a^2\\), \\(b^2\\), and \\(c^2\\) are close to 0. This implies that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are close to 0.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the inequality\n\nWe need to evaluate:\n\\[\na b c(a+b+c-2a b c).\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are small, the product \\(a b c\\) is very small. The expression \\(a+b+c\\) is also small, and \\(2a b c\\) is even smaller. Therefore, the term \\(a+b+c-2a b c\\) is approximately equal to \\(a+b+c\\).\n\nThus, the expression \\(a b c(a+b+c-2a b c)\\) is approximately:\n\\[\na b c \\cdot (a+b+c) \\approx a b c \\cdot a + a b c \\cdot b + a b c \\cdot c = a^2 b c + a b^2 c + a b c^2.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compare with \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\)\n\nSince \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are small, the terms \\(a^2 b c\\), \\(a b^2 c\\), and \\(a b c^2\\) are all very small, making the entire expression \\(a b c(a+b+c-2a b c)\\) very small.\n\nThus, it is reasonable to conclude that:\n\\[\na b c(a+b+c-2a b c) < \\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct inequality relation is:\n\\[\na b c(a+b+c-2a b c) < \\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe answer is (D) $<$.",
