## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given expression:

\[
S = \sqrt{a_1^2 + (1-a_2)^2} + \sqrt{a_2^2 + (1-a_3)^2} + \ldots + \sqrt{a_n^2 + (1-a_1)^2}
\]

and compare it to \(\frac{n}{2}\).

Each term in the sum \(S\) is of the form \(\sqrt{a_i^2 + (1-a_{i+1})^2}\). We can interpret each term as the Euclidean distance from the point \((a_i, 1-a_{i+1})\) to the origin \((0, 0)\) in the plane.

To find a bound for each term, we use the fact that for any real numbers \(x\) and \(y\), the Euclidean distance \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) is minimized when both \(x\) and \(y\) are zero, and it is maximized when both \(x\) and \(y\) are as large as possible in magnitude.

Consider the expression \(\sqrt{a_i^2 + (1-a_{i+1})^2}\). By the triangle inequality, we have:

\[
\sqrt{a_i^2 + (1-a_{i+1})^2} \geq \left| a_i \right| + \left| 1-a_{i+1} \right|
\]

However, this inequality is not tight for all values of \(a_i\) and \(a_{i+1}\). Instead, we can use the fact that the minimum value of \(\sqrt{a_i^2 + (1-a_{i+1})^2}\) is achieved when \(a_i = 0\) and \(1-a_{i+1} = 0\), which gives:

\[
\sqrt{a_i^2 + (1-a_{i+1})^2} \geq 1
\]

Thus, each term \(\sqrt{a_i^2 + (1-a_{i+1})^2} \geq 1\), and there are \(n\) such terms in the sum \(S\). Therefore, we have:

\[
S \geq n
\]

Now, we compare this with \(\frac{n}{2}\). Clearly, since \(n > 1\), we have:

\[
n > \frac{n}{2}
\]

Thus, the inequality \(S \geq n\) implies:

\[
S > \frac{n}{2}
\]

Therefore, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is:

The answer is (E) $>$.
