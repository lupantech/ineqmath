## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given inequality:

\[
\sum \frac{ab}{(a+b)(c^2+1)} \quad () \quad \frac{5}{4(a+b+c)}
\]

where \( a, b, c \geq 0 \) and \( ab + bc + ca = 1 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Left-Hand Side

The left-hand side of the inequality is:

\[
\sum \frac{ab}{(a+b)(c^2+1)} = \frac{ab}{(a+b)(c^2+1)} + \frac{bc}{(b+c)(a^2+1)} + \frac{ca}{(c+a)(b^2+1)}
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Right-Hand Side

The right-hand side of the inequality is:

\[
\frac{5}{4(a+b+c)}
\]

### Step 3: Consider Special Cases

To gain insight, consider special cases where \( a, b, c \) are equal or one of them is zero.

#### Case 1: \( a = b = c \)

If \( a = b = c \), then \( ab + bc + ca = 3a^2 = 1 \), so \( a^2 = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \).

Substitute into the inequality:

- Left-hand side:
  \[
  \sum \frac{ab}{(a+b)(c^2+1)} = 3 \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}{\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3} + 1\right)} = 3 \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{4}{3}} = \frac{3}{\frac{8}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}
  \]

- Right-hand side:
  \[
  \frac{5}{4(a+b+c)} = \frac{5}{4 \cdot 3 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{12}
  \]

Compare the two sides:
\[
\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \quad \text{vs} \quad \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{12}
\]

Convert to a common denominator:
- \(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{24}\)
- \(\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{12} = \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{24}\)

Thus, \(\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{24} < \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{24}\).

#### Case 2: \( a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 \)

Here, \( ab + bc + ca = 0 \), which does not satisfy the condition \( ab + bc + ca = 1 \).

### Step 4: General Consideration

The inequality seems to hold for the case \( a = b = c \). We suspect that the inequality is generally \( < \).

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and special case, the inequality is likely to be:

\[
\sum \frac{ab}{(a+b)(c^2+1)} < \frac{5}{4(a+b+c)}
\]

Thus, the correct option is:

\[
\text{The answer is (D) } <
\]
