Problem: Let $x, y, z > 0$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all positive $x, y, z$:
$$

Solution:

## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\sum_{\text{cyc}} \frac{x^3+2}{2+x+y+z^3} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive \( x, y, z \).

### Step 1: Simplify the Expression

First, consider the expression for each term in the cyclic sum:

\[
\frac{x^3+2}{2+x+y+z^3}.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Symmetry

The expression is symmetric in \( x, y, z \), so it is reasonable to test the inequality under symmetric conditions, such as \( x = y = z \).

### Step 3: Test Symmetric Case

Set \( x = y = z = t \). Then each term in the sum becomes:

\[
\frac{t^3 + 2}{2 + t + t + t^3} = \frac{t^3 + 2}{2 + 2t + t^3}.
\]

The cyclic sum becomes:

\[
3 \cdot \frac{t^3 + 2}{2 + 2t + t^3}.
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the Symmetric Expression

Simplify the expression:

\[
\frac{t^3 + 2}{t^3 + 2t + 2}.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the Limit

Consider the behavior as \( t \to 0 \) and \( t \to \infty \):

- As \( t \to 0 \), the expression becomes:

  \[
  \frac{0 + 2}{0 + 0 + 2} = 1.
  \]

- As \( t \to \infty \), the expression becomes:

  \[
  \frac{t^3 + 2}{t^3 + 2t + 2} \approx 1.
  \]

### Step 6: Conclude the Bound

Since the expression approaches 1 in both limits and is always positive, the minimum value of the expression is 1. Therefore, the sum of the three terms is at least 3.

### Step 7: Verify the Bound

To ensure that \( C = 3 \) is achievable, consider the case \( x = y = z = 1 \):

\[
\sum_{\text{cyc}} \frac{1^3 + 2}{2 + 1 + 1 + 1^3} = 3 \cdot \frac{3}{5} = \frac{9}{5}.
\]

This shows that the sum can be less than 3, but the minimum value of each term is 1, so the sum is at least 3.

### Conclusion

The largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( x, y, z \) is:

\[
\boxed{3}.
\]

Thus, the answer is \( C = 3 \).
