## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given expression and compare it with the area of the triangle \(\Delta\).

First, recall that the area \(\Delta\) of triangle \(\triangle ABC\) can be expressed in terms of the sides and the angles as:

\[
\Delta = \frac{1}{2} ab \sin C = \frac{1}{2} bc \sin A = \frac{1}{2} ca \sin B
\]

where \(a = BC\), \(b = CA\), and \(c = AB\).

The perpendiculars \(u\), \(v\), and \(w\) from points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) to the line \(L\) can be related to the area of the triangle. Specifically, the area of the triangle can also be expressed using these perpendiculars:

\[
\Delta = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot u = \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot v = \frac{1}{2} \cdot c \cdot w
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
u = \frac{2\Delta}{a}, \quad v = \frac{2\Delta}{b}, \quad w = \frac{2\Delta}{c}
\]

Now, consider the expression \(u^2 \tan A + v^2 \tan B + w^2 \tan C\). Substituting the expressions for \(u\), \(v\), and \(w\), we get:

\[
u^2 = \left(\frac{2\Delta}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{4\Delta^2}{a^2}
\]
\[
v^2 = \left(\frac{2\Delta}{b}\right)^2 = \frac{4\Delta^2}{b^2}
\]
\[
w^2 = \left(\frac{2\Delta}{c}\right)^2 = \frac{4\Delta^2}{c^2}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u^2 \tan A + v^2 \tan B + w^2 \tan C = \frac{4\Delta^2}{a^2} \tan A + \frac{4\Delta^2}{b^2} \tan B + \frac{4\Delta^2}{c^2} \tan C
\]

Factor out \(4\Delta^2\):

\[
= 4\Delta^2 \left( \frac{\tan A}{a^2} + \frac{\tan B}{b^2} + \frac{\tan C}{c^2} \right)
\]

We need to compare this with \(\Delta\). Simplifying, we have:

\[
4\Delta^2 \left( \frac{\tan A}{a^2} + \frac{\tan B}{b^2} + \frac{\tan C}{c^2} \right) \quad () \quad \Delta
\]

Divide both sides by \(\Delta\):

\[
4\Delta \left( \frac{\tan A}{a^2} + \frac{\tan B}{b^2} + \frac{\tan C}{c^2} \right) \quad () \quad 1
\]

Now, consider the identity for the tangent of angles in a triangle:

\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}, \quad \tan B = \frac{\sin B}{\cos B}, \quad \tan C = \frac{\sin C}{\cos C}
\]

Using the fact that \(\sin A = \frac{a}{2R}\), \(\sin B = \frac{b}{2R}\), \(\sin C = \frac{c}{2R}\) where \(R\) is the circumradius, and the fact that \(\cos A\), \(\cos B\), \(\cos C\) are positive in an acute triangle, we can see that:

\[
\frac{\tan A}{a^2} + \frac{\tan B}{b^2} + \frac{\tan C}{c^2} > 0
\]

Thus, the expression \(4\Delta \left( \frac{\tan A}{a^2} + \frac{\tan B}{b^2} + \frac{\tan C}{c^2} \right)\) is positive and greater than 1, leading to:

\[
4\Delta \left( \frac{\tan A}{a^2} + \frac{\tan B}{b^2} + \frac{\tan C}{c^2} \right) > 1
\]

Therefore, the inequality is:

\[
u^2 \tan A + v^2 \tan B + w^2 \tan C > \Delta
\]

The answer is (E) $>$.
