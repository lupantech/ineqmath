## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimal constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{1}{2}(a+b)^2 + C(a+b) \geq a \sqrt{b} + b \sqrt{a}
\]

holds for all \( a, b > 0 \).

First, expand the left-hand side:

\[
\frac{1}{2}(a+b)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = \frac{1}{2}a^2 + ab + \frac{1}{2}b^2.
\]

Thus, the inequality becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2}a^2 + ab + \frac{1}{2}b^2 + C(a+b) \geq a \sqrt{b} + b \sqrt{a}.
\]

Rearrange terms:

\[
\frac{1}{2}a^2 + ab + \frac{1}{2}b^2 + Ca + Cb - a \sqrt{b} - b \sqrt{a} \geq 0.
\]

To find the minimal \( C \), consider the case when \( a = b \). In this case, the inequality simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{2}(2a)^2 + 2Ca \geq 2a\sqrt{a}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2a^2 + 2Ca \geq 2a^{3/2}.
\]

Divide through by \( 2a \) (assuming \( a > 0 \)):

\[
a + C \geq a^{1/2}.
\]

Rearrange to find:

\[
C \geq a^{1/2} - a.
\]

The function \( a^{1/2} - a \) is maximized when \( a = 1 \), since the derivative \( \frac{d}{da}(a^{1/2} - a) = \frac{1}{2}a^{-1/2} - 1 \) is zero at \( a = 1 \). At \( a = 1 \), \( a^{1/2} - a = 1 - 1 = 0 \).

Now, consider the case when \( a \neq b \). Use the AM-GM inequality:

\[
a \sqrt{b} \leq \frac{a^2 + b}{2}, \quad b \sqrt{a} \leq \frac{b^2 + a}{2}.
\]

Adding these inequalities gives:

\[
a \sqrt{b} + b \sqrt{a} \leq \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} + \frac{a + b}{2}.
\]

Thus, the inequality

\[
\frac{1}{2}a^2 + ab + \frac{1}{2}b^2 + Ca + Cb \geq \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} + \frac{a + b}{2}
\]

is satisfied for \( C \geq \frac{1}{2} \).

Therefore, the minimal constant \( C \) that satisfies the inequality for all \( a, b > 0 \) is \( C = \frac{1}{2} \).

The answer is \( C = \frac{1}{2} \).
