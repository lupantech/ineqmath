## Response

To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct inequality relation between the two expressions:

1. \( 9a^2b^2c^2 \)
2. \((a^2b + b^2c + c^2a)(ab^2 + bc^2 + ca^2)\)

We will use the AM-GM inequality to compare these expressions. The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\), the following holds:

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}
\]

with equality if and only if \(x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n\).

### Step 1: Apply AM-GM to each term

Consider the terms in the first product:

- \(a^2b\), \(b^2c\), \(c^2a\)

By AM-GM, we have:

\[
\frac{a^2b + b^2c + c^2a}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{a^2b \cdot b^2c \cdot c^2a} = \sqrt[3]{a^2b^2c^2 \cdot abc} = \sqrt[3]{a^3b^3c^3} = abc
\]

Thus:

\[
a^2b + b^2c + c^2a \geq 3abc
\]

Similarly, for the second product:

- \(ab^2\), \(bc^2\), \(ca^2\)

By AM-GM, we have:

\[
\frac{ab^2 + bc^2 + ca^2}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{ab^2 \cdot bc^2 \cdot ca^2} = \sqrt[3]{a^2b^2c^2 \cdot abc} = \sqrt[3]{a^3b^3c^3} = abc
\]

Thus:

\[
ab^2 + bc^2 + ca^2 \geq 3abc
\]

### Step 2: Multiply the inequalities

Now, multiply the two inequalities:

\[
(a^2b + b^2c + c^2a)(ab^2 + bc^2 + ca^2) \geq (3abc)(3abc) = 9a^2b^2c^2
\]

This shows that:

\[
9a^2b^2c^2 \leq (a^2b + b^2c + c^2a)(ab^2 + bc^2 + ca^2)
\]

### Step 3: Check for equality

Equality in the AM-GM inequality holds when all terms are equal. For both inequalities, equality holds when:

- \(a^2b = b^2c = c^2a\)
- \(ab^2 = bc^2 = ca^2\)

This implies \(a = b = c\). Therefore, equality holds when \(a = b = c\).

### Conclusion

The inequality \(9a^2b^2c^2 \leq (a^2b + b^2c + c^2a)(ab^2 + bc^2 + ca^2)\) holds for all positive \(a, b, c\), with equality when \(a = b = c\).

Thus, the correct inequality relation is \(\leq\).

The answer is (A) \(\leq\).
