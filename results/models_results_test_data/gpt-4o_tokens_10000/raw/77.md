## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
abc + \frac{17}{ab + bc + ca} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) satisfying \( a + b + c = 3 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the expression

First, consider the expression \( abc + \frac{17}{ab + bc + ca} \). We need to find a lower bound for this expression.

### Step 2: Use AM-GM inequality

By the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[
a + b + c = 3 \geq 3\sqrt[3]{abc} \implies abc \leq 1.
\]

### Step 3: Consider symmetry and special cases

To find the minimum value, consider the symmetric case where \( a = b = c = 1 \). Then:

\[
abc = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad ab + bc + ca = 3.
\]

Substituting these into the expression gives:

\[
abc + \frac{17}{ab + bc + ca} = 1 + \frac{17}{3} = \frac{20}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: Check other configurations

To ensure this is the minimum, consider other configurations. For instance, let \( a = 0, b = 1.5, c = 1.5 \). Then:

\[
abc = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad ab + bc + ca = 0 + 1.5 \times 1.5 + 1.5 \times 0 = 2.25.
\]

Substituting these into the expression gives:

\[
abc + \frac{17}{ab + bc + ca} = 0 + \frac{17}{2.25} = \frac{68}{9} \approx 7.56.
\]

This is greater than \(\frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67\).

### Step 5: Consider the limit as one variable approaches zero

Consider the case where \( a \to 0^+ \), \( b = 1.5 \), and \( c = 1.5 \). Then:

\[
abc \to 0 \quad \text{and} \quad ab + bc + ca \to 2.25.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
abc + \frac{17}{ab + bc + ca} \to \frac{68}{9}.
\]

### Conclusion

The minimum value of the expression occurs when \( a = b = c = 1 \), giving us:

\[
abc + \frac{17}{ab + bc + ca} = \frac{20}{3}.
\]

Thus, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all positive \( a, b, c \) with \( a + b + c = 3 \) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{20}{3}}
\]

The answer is \( C = \frac{20}{3} \).
