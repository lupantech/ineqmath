## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given inequality and determine the correct relation between the two expressions.

The inequality to consider is:

\[
\sum \frac{(b^2+c^2)(a-b)(a-c)}{(a+b)(a+c)} \quad () \quad a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2ab - 3bc - ca
\]

First, let's expand and simplify the right-hand side:

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2ab - 3bc - ca
\]

This expression can be rewritten as:

\[
(a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2 - 2bc - ca
\]

Now, let's consider the left-hand side:

\[
\sum \frac{(b^2+c^2)(a-b)(a-c)}{(a+b)(a+c)}
\]

This is a cyclic sum, meaning we need to evaluate it for each permutation of \(a, b, c\) and sum the results. Let's analyze one term:

\[
\frac{(b^2+c^2)(a-b)(a-c)}{(a+b)(a+c)}
\]

This term is symmetric in \(b\) and \(c\), and it is zero when \(a = b\) or \(a = c\). The expression \((a-b)(a-c)\) changes sign depending on the relative sizes of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

To determine the inequality, we can test specific cases or use known inequalities. A common approach is to test the inequality when \(a = b = c\). In this case, both sides of the inequality become zero:

- Left-hand side: \(\sum \frac{(b^2+c^2)(a-b)(a-c)}{(a+b)(a+c)} = 0\)
- Right-hand side: \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2ab - 3bc - ca = 0\)

Thus, the inequality holds as an equality when \(a = b = c\).

Next, consider the case when \(a, b, c\) are distinct. The expression on the left-hand side involves terms that are generally non-positive due to the factor \((a-b)(a-c)\) in the numerator, which can be negative or zero. The right-hand side, however, can be negative or zero depending on the specific values of \(a, b, c\).

To further analyze, consider the symmetry and behavior of the expressions. The left-hand side is a sum of terms that are zero when any two of \(a, b, c\) are equal, and the right-hand side is also zero in such cases. This suggests that the inequality might hold as an equality in general.

However, the structure of the terms suggests that the left-hand side is generally less than or equal to the right-hand side, as the terms in the sum are non-positive or zero, and the right-hand side can be zero or negative.

Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:

\[
\sum \frac{(b^2+c^2)(a-b)(a-c)}{(a+b)(a+c)} \leq a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2ab - 3bc - ca
\]

Thus, the answer is:

The answer is (A) $\leq$.
