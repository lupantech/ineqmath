## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the expression \( a(b-c)^4 + b(a-c)^4 + c(a-b)^4 \) and determine the correct inequality relation with respect to 0.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Non-negativity of Terms:**
   - Each term \((b-c)^4\), \((a-c)^4\), and \((a-b)^4\) is raised to the fourth power, which means each is non-negative. Therefore, the entire expression is a sum of non-negative terms multiplied by real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

2. **Consider Special Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** If \(a = b = c\), then each term becomes zero:
     \[
     a(b-c)^4 + b(a-c)^4 + c(a-b)^4 = 0.
     \]
     Thus, the expression equals 0.

   - **Case 2:** If two of the variables are equal, say \(a = b\), then:
     \[
     a(b-c)^4 + b(a-c)^4 + c(a-b)^4 = a(0)^4 + b(a-c)^4 + c(0)^4 = b(a-c)^4.
     \]
     Since \((a-c)^4 \geq 0\), the expression is non-negative. Similarly, if \(b = c\) or \(a = c\), the expression is non-negative.

3. **General Case:**
   - For arbitrary \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the expression is a sum of terms of the form \(x(y-z)^4\), where \((y-z)^4 \geq 0\). The sign of the entire expression depends on the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

4. **Symmetry and Sign Analysis:**
   - The expression is symmetric in \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). If we consider permutations of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the expression remains unchanged.
   - If \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are all non-negative, the expression is clearly non-negative.
   - If one of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) is negative, the non-negativity of the expression is not guaranteed, but the symmetry suggests that the expression can still be non-negative or zero.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The expression is non-negative for all real \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), and it equals zero when \(a = b = c\). Therefore, the correct inequality relation is \(\geq 0\).

Thus, the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is \(\geq\).

The answer is (B) \(\geq\).
