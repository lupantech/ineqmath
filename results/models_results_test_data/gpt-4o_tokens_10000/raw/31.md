## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality \( BD^2 \leq C \cdot AC^2 \) holds if and only if \( AB \cdot BC = 2AD \cdot DC \) for a cyclic quadrilateral \( ABCD \).

### Step 1: Use Ptolemy's Theorem
For a cyclic quadrilateral \( ABCD \), Ptolemy's Theorem states:
\[
AB \cdot CD + AD \cdot BC = AC \cdot BD
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Given Condition
We are given the condition \( AB \cdot BC = 2AD \cdot DC \). Let's substitute this into Ptolemy's Theorem:
\[
2AD \cdot DC + AD \cdot BC = AC \cdot BD
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the Expression
Substitute \( AB \cdot BC = 2AD \cdot DC \) into the equation:
\[
2AD \cdot DC + AD \cdot BC = AC \cdot BD
\]
\[
AD \cdot (2DC + BC) = AC \cdot BD
\]

### Step 4: Express \( BD^2 \) in Terms of \( AC^2 \)
We need to find \( C \) such that:
\[
BD^2 \leq C \cdot AC^2
\]

From the equation \( AD \cdot (2DC + BC) = AC \cdot BD \), we can express \( BD \) as:
\[
BD = \frac{AD \cdot (2DC + BC)}{AC}
\]

Square both sides:
\[
BD^2 = \left(\frac{AD \cdot (2DC + BC)}{AC}\right)^2
\]

### Step 5: Find the Smallest \( C \)
We want:
\[
\left(\frac{AD \cdot (2DC + BC)}{AC}\right)^2 \leq C \cdot AC^2
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{AD^2 \cdot (2DC + BC)^2}{AC^2} \leq C \cdot AC^2
\]

This implies:
\[
AD^2 \cdot (2DC + BC)^2 \leq C \cdot AC^4
\]

### Step 6: Determine the Smallest \( C \)
To find the smallest \( C \), consider the equality case:
\[
AD^2 \cdot (2DC + BC)^2 = C \cdot AC^4
\]

Assume \( AC = 1 \) for simplicity, then:
\[
AD^2 \cdot (2DC + BC)^2 = C
\]

The smallest \( C \) occurs when \( AD = 1 \), \( 2DC + BC = 1 \), giving:
\[
C = 1
\]

Thus, the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]

The answer is \( C = 2 \) because the inequality \( BD^2 \leq 2 \cdot AC^2 \) holds under the given condition \( AB \cdot BC = 2AD \cdot DC \).

The answer is \( C = 2 \).
