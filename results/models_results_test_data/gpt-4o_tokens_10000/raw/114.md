## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and the expressions involved. We have four positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(abcd = 1\). We are given the inequality:

\[
a + b + c + d > \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{d} + \frac{d}{a}.
\]

We need to determine the relationship between \(a + b + c + d\) and \(\frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d}\).

### Step 1: Analyze the given inequality

The inequality \(a + b + c + d > \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{d} + \frac{d}{a}\) suggests that the sum of the numbers is greater than a certain sum of fractions. 

### Step 2: Consider the AM-GM inequality

By the AM-GM inequality, for any positive real numbers \(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\), we have:

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4}{4} \geq \sqrt[4]{x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4}.
\]

Applying this to \(a, b, c, d\), we get:

\[
\frac{a + b + c + d}{4} \geq \sqrt[4]{abcd} = 1.
\]

Thus, \(a + b + c + d \geq 4\).

### Step 3: Analyze the expression \(\frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d}\)

Similarly, applying AM-GM to \(\frac{b}{a}, \frac{c}{b}, \frac{d}{c}, \frac{a}{d}\), we have:

\[
\frac{\frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d}}{4} \geq \sqrt[4]{\frac{b}{a} \cdot \frac{c}{b} \cdot \frac{d}{c} \cdot \frac{a}{d}} = 1.
\]

Thus, \(\frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d} \geq 4\).

### Step 4: Compare the two expressions

We know from the AM-GM inequality that both \(a + b + c + d\) and \(\frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d}\) are at least 4. However, the given condition \(a + b + c + d > \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{d} + \frac{d}{a}\) implies that \(a + b + c + d\) is strictly greater than the sum of those fractions.

Now, we need to determine the relationship between \(a + b + c + d\) and \(\frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d}\). Since both are at least 4, and the given inequality suggests that \(a + b + c + d\) is greater than another sum of similar structure, it is reasonable to conclude that:

\[
a + b + c + d > \frac{b}{a} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{d}{c} + \frac{a}{d}.
\]

Thus, the correct inequality relation is:

The answer is (E) $>$.
