## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and the inequality we are asked to evaluate.

We are given that \( a, b, c > 0 \) and 

\[
\sum \frac{1}{a^2+1} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

This can be expanded as:

\[
\frac{1}{a^2+1} + \frac{1}{b^2+1} + \frac{1}{c^2+1} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

We need to determine the relationship between 

\[
\sum \frac{1}{a^3+3}
\]

and \(\frac{1}{3}\).

### Step 1: Analyze the given condition

The condition \(\sum \frac{1}{a^2+1} = \frac{1}{2}\) implies that the average of the terms \(\frac{1}{a^2+1}, \frac{1}{b^2+1}, \frac{1}{c^2+1}\) is \(\frac{1}{6}\).

### Step 2: Consider the inequality

We need to compare 

\[
\sum \frac{1}{a^3+3}
\]

to \(\frac{1}{3}\).

### Step 3: Use inequalities to compare terms

Notice that for positive \(x\), \(x^3 + 3 \geq x^2 + 1\). This is because:

\[
x^3 + 3 - (x^2 + 1) = x^3 - x^2 + 2 = x^2(x-1) + 2 \geq 0
\]

for \(x > 0\). Therefore, 

\[
\frac{1}{x^3 + 3} \leq \frac{1}{x^2 + 1}.
\]

### Step 4: Apply the inequality to the sum

Applying this inequality to each term in the sum, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{a^3+3} \leq \frac{1}{a^2+1}, \quad \frac{1}{b^3+3} \leq \frac{1}{b^2+1}, \quad \frac{1}{c^3+3} \leq \frac{1}{c^2+1}.
\]

Summing these inequalities gives:

\[
\sum \frac{1}{a^3+3} \leq \sum \frac{1}{a^2+1} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with \(\frac{1}{3}\)

Since \(\sum \frac{1}{a^3+3} \leq \frac{1}{2}\), it follows that:

\[
\sum \frac{1}{a^3+3} \geq \frac{1}{3}
\]

is not necessarily true, but:

\[
\sum \frac{1}{a^3+3} \leq \frac{1}{3}
\]

is possible. However, since \(\sum \frac{1}{a^3+3} \leq \frac{1}{2}\), it is not strictly less than \(\frac{1}{3}\) in all cases, but it is certainly less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\).

Thus, the correct inequality is:

\[
\sum \frac{1}{a^3+3} \leq \frac{1}{3}.
\]

The answer is (A) \(\leq\).
