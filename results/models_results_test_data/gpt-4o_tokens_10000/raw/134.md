## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given expression and determine the correct inequality relation between the two sides.

We have a triangle \( ABC \) with point \( P \) inside it. The distances from \( P \) to the sides \( BC, CA, \) and \( AB \) are \( d_a, d_b, \) and \( d_c \) respectively. The altitudes from vertices \( A, B, \) and \( C \) to the opposite sides are \( h_a, h_b, \) and \( h_c \).

The expression we need to analyze is:

\[
d_a \cdot h_a^2 + d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \quad () \quad (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3
\]

### Step 1: Understanding the Terms

- \( d_a, d_b, d_c \) are the perpendicular distances from point \( P \) to the sides of the triangle.
- \( h_a, h_b, h_c \) are the altitudes of the triangle, which are fixed for a given triangle.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Expression

The left side of the inequality is a weighted sum of the squares of the altitudes, with weights being the distances from \( P \) to the sides. The right side is the cube of the sum of these distances.

### Step 3: Consider Special Cases

1. **Case when \( P \) is the centroid:**

   When \( P \) is the centroid, the distances \( d_a, d_b, d_c \) are such that they are proportional to the areas of the sub-triangles \( PBC, PCA, \) and \( PAB \). In this case, the expression simplifies due to symmetry, but it doesn't directly help in comparing the two sides.

2. **Case when \( P \) is on a side:**

   If \( P \) is on one of the sides, say \( BC \), then \( d_a = 0 \) and \( d_b, d_c \) are the distances from \( P \) to the sides \( CA \) and \( AB \). The expression becomes:

   \[
   d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \quad () \quad (d_b + d_c)^3
   \]

   This is still not straightforward to compare without specific values.

### Step 4: General Consideration

The expression \( d_a \cdot h_a^2 + d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \) is a linear combination of the squares of the altitudes, while \( (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3 \) is a cubic expression. Generally, for positive values, a cubic expression grows faster than a linear one, suggesting that:

\[
d_a \cdot h_a^2 + d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \leq (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3
\]

However, without loss of generality, the inequality might not hold strictly for all configurations, especially when \( P \) approaches the centroid or other symmetric points.

### Conclusion

Given the nature of the expressions and typical behavior of linear versus cubic growth, the most reasonable inequality is:

\[
d_a \cdot h_a^2 + d_b \cdot h_b^2 + d_c \cdot h_c^2 \leq (d_a + d_b + d_c)^3
\]

Thus, the correct inequality relation is:

The answer is (A) \(\leq\).
