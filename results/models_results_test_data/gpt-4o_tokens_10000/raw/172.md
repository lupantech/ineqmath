## Response

To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the perimeter of the triangle \(a + b + c\) and the expression \(4R + 2r\), where \(R\) is the circumradius and \(r\) is the inradius of the triangle.

### Step 1: Recall known inequalities

For any triangle, there is a well-known inequality involving the sides, circumradius, and inradius:
\[
a + b + c \geq 2 \sqrt{3} R
\]
This inequality is derived from the fact that the semiperimeter \(s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}\) satisfies \(s \geq 3r\) and the fact that \(R \geq \frac{a}{2\sin A}\) for any angle \(A\) in the triangle.

### Step 2: Compare \(2\sqrt{3}R\) and \(4R + 2r\)

We need to compare \(2\sqrt{3}R\) with \(4R + 2r\). Notice that:
- \(2\sqrt{3} \approx 3.464\), which is less than 4.
- Therefore, \(2\sqrt{3}R < 4R\).

Since \(2\sqrt{3}R < 4R\), it follows that:
\[
2\sqrt{3}R < 4R + 2r
\]

### Step 3: Conclude the inequality

From the inequality \(a + b + c \geq 2\sqrt{3}R\) and the fact that \(2\sqrt{3}R < 4R + 2r\), we can conclude:
\[
a + b + c \geq 2\sqrt{3}R < 4R + 2r
\]

Thus, the correct inequality is:
\[
a + b + c < 4R + 2r
\]

### Conclusion

The correct inequality relation to fill in the blank is \(<\). Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
