## Response

To solve this problem, we need to compare the two expressions:

1. \( E_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2a}{a+b}} + \sqrt{\frac{b}{2b+c}} + \sqrt{\frac{c}{3c+a}} \)
2. \( E_2 = \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{a^2+b^2+c^2} \)

We will analyze each expression and try to establish a relationship between them.

### Step 1: Analyze \( E_1 \)

The expression \( E_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2a}{a+b}} + \sqrt{\frac{b}{2b+c}} + \sqrt{\frac{c}{3c+a}} \) consists of three terms, each of which is a square root of a fraction. Each fraction has a numerator that is a multiple of one of the variables and a denominator that is a sum involving the other variables.

### Step 2: Analyze \( E_2 \)

The expression \( E_2 = \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{a^2+b^2+c^2} \) is a ratio of the square of the sum of the variables to the sum of the squares of the variables. This expression is always greater than or equal to 1 due to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\[
(a+b+c)^2 \leq 3(a^2+b^2+c^2)
\]

Thus, 

\[
\frac{(a+b+c)^2}{a^2+b^2+c^2} \leq 3
\]

### Step 3: Compare \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \)

To compare \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we need to consider the behavior of each term in \( E_1 \) and the possible values of \( E_2 \).

#### Consider the case when \( a = b = c \)

If \( a = b = c \), then:

- \( E_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2a}{2a}} + \sqrt{\frac{a}{3a}} + \sqrt{\frac{a}{4a}} = 1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + \frac{1}{2} \)

Calculating this gives:

\[
E_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + \frac{1}{2} \approx 1 + 0.577 + 0.5 = 2.077
\]

- \( E_2 = \frac{(3a)^2}{3a^2} = 3 \)

In this case, \( E_1 < E_2 \).

#### General case

For general positive \( a, b, c \), the terms in \( E_1 \) are each less than or equal to 1, since:

- \(\sqrt{\frac{2a}{a+b}} \leq \sqrt{2}\)
- \(\sqrt{\frac{b}{2b+c}} \leq 1\)
- \(\sqrt{\frac{c}{3c+a}} \leq 1\)

Thus, \( E_1 \) is generally less than or equal to 3, and often less than 3, while \( E_2 \) is always greater than or equal to 1 and can be as large as 3.

### Conclusion

From the analysis, \( E_1 \) is generally less than \( E_2 \), especially when \( a = b = c \). Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:

\[
E_1 < E_2
\]

The answer is (D) $<$.
