## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given condition and the inequality to determine the correct relation.

We are given:
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1 + 5abcd. \]

We need to determine the relationship between:
\[ a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2 \]
and
\[ \frac{3}{5}. \]

First, let's consider the given equation:
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1 + 5abcd. \]

This equation suggests a balance between the sum of squares of the variables and a term involving their product. The right-hand side, \(1 + 5abcd\), implies that the sum of squares is slightly larger than 1 when \(abcd\) is positive, and slightly less than 1 when \(abcd\) is negative.

Now, let's analyze the expression we need to compare:
\[ a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2. \]

We can rewrite this expression in terms of the given condition:
\[ a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2 = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) + 2b^2 + c^2. \]

Substituting the given condition:
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1 + 5abcd, \]
we have:
\[ a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2 = (1 + 5abcd) + 2b^2 + c^2. \]

Thus:
\[ a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2 = 1 + 5abcd + 2b^2 + c^2. \]

Now, we need to compare this with \(\frac{3}{5}\).

To find a relationship, consider the case when \(a = b = c = d = \frac{1}{2}\). Then:
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 1, \]
and
\[ abcd = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}. \]

Substituting into the given condition:
\[ 1 = 1 + 5 \times \frac{1}{16}, \]
which simplifies to:
\[ 1 = 1 + \frac{5}{16}, \]
which is not true. Therefore, \(a = b = c = d = \frac{1}{2}\) is not a valid solution.

Instead, consider the case when \(a = b = c = d = 0\). Then:
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 0, \]
and
\[ abcd = 0. \]

Substituting into the given condition:
\[ 0 = 1 + 5 \times 0, \]
which simplifies to:
\[ 0 = 1, \]
which is also not true.

Let's try another approach by considering the symmetry and possible values of \(a, b, c, d\).

Assume \(a = b = c = d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\). Then:
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 \times \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = 2, \]
and
\[ abcd = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{4}. \]

Substituting into the given condition:
\[ 2 = 1 + 5 \times \frac{1}{4}, \]
which simplifies to:
\[ 2 = 1 + \frac{5}{4}, \]
which is not true.

Let's try \(a = 1, b = c = d = 0\). Then:
\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1, \]
and
\[ abcd = 0. \]

Substituting into the given condition:
\[ 1 = 1 + 5 \times 0, \]
which simplifies to:
\[ 1 = 1, \]
which is true.

For this case:
\[ a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2 = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1. \]

Since \(1 > \frac{3}{5}\), this suggests that the expression is greater than \(\frac{3}{5}\).

Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:
\[ a^2 + 3b^2 + 2c^2 + d^2 > \frac{3}{5}. \]

The answer is (E) $>$.
