## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{\sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}}{n-1} \geq C
\]

holds for all positive numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) satisfying

\[
\frac{1}{x_1+1998}+\frac{1}{x_2+1998}+\cdots+\frac{1}{x_n+1998}=\frac{1}{1998}.
\]

First, let's analyze the given condition. We have:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x_i + 1998} = \frac{1}{1998}.
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{x_i + 1998} = \frac{1}{1998}.
\]

Multiplying both sides by 1998, we get:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1998}{x_i + 1998} = 1.
\]

Now, consider the function \( f(x) = \frac{1998}{x + 1998} \). This function is decreasing because its derivative \( f'(x) = -\frac{1998}{(x + 1998)^2} \) is negative for all \( x > 0 \).

To maximize the geometric mean \( \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n} \), we should try to make the \( x_i \) as equal as possible, due to the AM-GM inequality. Let's assume \( x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n = x \). Then:

\[
n \cdot \frac{1998}{x + 1998} = 1 \implies \frac{1998}{x + 1998} = \frac{1}{n}.
\]

Solving for \( x \), we have:

\[
1998 = \frac{x + 1998}{n} \implies x + 1998 = 1998n \implies x = 1998n - 1998.
\]

Thus, each \( x_i = 1998(n-1) \).

Now, calculate the geometric mean:

\[
\sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n} = \sqrt[n]{(1998(n-1))^n} = 1998(n-1).
\]

Substitute this into the inequality:

\[
\frac{\sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}}{n-1} = \frac{1998(n-1)}{n-1} = 1998.
\]

Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality holds for all \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) is:

\[
C = 1998.
\]

The answer is \(\boxed{C=1998}\).
