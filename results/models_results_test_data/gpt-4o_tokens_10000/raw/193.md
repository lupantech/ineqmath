## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the expression \( x \sqrt{1-y^2} + y \sqrt{1-x^2} \) and determine its relationship with \(\frac{3}{2}\) given the constraints \(-1 \leq x, y \leq 1\).

### Step 1: Analyze the Expression

The expression is:
\[
x \sqrt{1-y^2} + y \sqrt{1-x^2}
\]

### Step 2: Consider the Range of Each Term

- The term \(\sqrt{1-y^2}\) is the length of the leg of a right triangle with hypotenuse 1 and other leg \(y\). Thus, \(\sqrt{1-y^2} \leq 1\).
- Similarly, \(\sqrt{1-x^2} \leq 1\).

### Step 3: Consider the Maximum and Minimum Values

- The maximum value of \(x \sqrt{1-y^2}\) is when \(x = 1\) and \(\sqrt{1-y^2} = 1\), giving \(1 \times 1 = 1\).
- The maximum value of \(y \sqrt{1-x^2}\) is when \(y = 1\) and \(\sqrt{1-x^2} = 1\), giving \(1 \times 1 = 1\).

Thus, the maximum possible value of the entire expression is:
\[
x \sqrt{1-y^2} + y \sqrt{1-x^2} \leq 1 + 1 = 2
\]

### Step 4: Consider the Minimum Value

- The minimum value of \(x \sqrt{1-y^2}\) is when \(x = -1\) and \(\sqrt{1-y^2} = 1\), giving \(-1 \times 1 = -1\).
- The minimum value of \(y \sqrt{1-x^2}\) is when \(y = -1\) and \(\sqrt{1-x^2} = 1\), giving \(-1 \times 1 = -1\).

Thus, the minimum possible value of the entire expression is:
\[
x \sqrt{1-y^2} + y \sqrt{1-x^2} \geq -1 - 1 = -2
\]

### Step 5: Compare with \(\frac{3}{2}\)

The range of the expression is \([-2, 2]\). Since \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) lies within this range, the expression can be less than, equal to, or greater than \(\frac{3}{2}\).

### Conclusion

Since the expression can take values both less than and greater than \(\frac{3}{2}\), there is no strict inequality that holds for all \(x, y\) in the given range. Therefore, the correct option is:

The answer is (F) None of the above.
