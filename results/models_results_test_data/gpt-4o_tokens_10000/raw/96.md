## Response

To solve this problem, we need to compare the two expressions:

1. \( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a} \)
2. \( \frac{c+2a}{c+b} + \frac{a+2b}{a+c} + \frac{b+2c}{b+a} \)

We will analyze each expression and try to establish a relationship between them.

### Step 1: Analyze the first expression

The expression \(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a}\) is a well-known cyclic sum. By the AM-GM inequality, we have:

\[
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a} \geq 3
\]

Equality holds when \(a = b = c\).

### Step 2: Analyze the second expression

The expression \(\frac{c+2a}{c+b} + \frac{a+2b}{a+c} + \frac{b+2c}{b+a}\) is more complex. We will use the Nesbitt's inequality as a reference, which states:

\[
\frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{a+c} + \frac{c}{a+b} \geq \frac{3}{2}
\]

However, our expression is not directly in the form of Nesbitt's inequality. Instead, let's consider the symmetry and try to simplify or estimate it.

### Step 3: Consider the case \(a = b = c\)

If \(a = b = c\), both expressions simplify:

- The first expression becomes:
  \[
  \frac{a}{a} + \frac{a}{a} + \frac{a}{a} = 3
  \]

- The second expression becomes:
  \[
  \frac{a+2a}{a+a} + \frac{a+2a}{a+a} + \frac{a+2a}{a+a} = \frac{3a}{2a} + \frac{3a}{2a} + \frac{3a}{2a} = \frac{9}{2}
  \]

In this case, \(3 < \frac{9}{2}\).

### Step 4: General case analysis

For general positive \(a, b, c\), the first expression is always at least 3 by AM-GM. The second expression, due to its structure, tends to be larger than 3, especially when the terms are not equal, as seen in the symmetric case.

### Conclusion

From the analysis, especially considering the case \(a = b = c\), we observe that the second expression is greater than the first. Therefore, the inequality relation is:

\[
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a} < \frac{c+2a}{c+b} + \frac{a+2b}{a+c} + \frac{b+2c}{b+a}
\]

Thus, the correct option is:

The answer is (D) $<$.
