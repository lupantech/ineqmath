## Response

To solve the problem, we need to determine the correct inequality relation for the expression:

\[
\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} \quad () \quad 2.
\]

We are given that \(a, b, c > 0\).

Let's analyze the expression:

1. **Consider the term \(\frac{c}{a}\):** This is positive since \(c > 0\) and \(a > 0\).

2. **Consider the term \(\frac{a}{b+c}\):** This is also positive since \(a > 0\) and \(b+c > 0\).

3. **Consider the term \(\frac{b}{c}\):** This is positive since \(b > 0\) and \(c > 0\).

All terms are positive, so the entire expression is positive.

Now, let's try to find a lower bound for the expression. We will use the AM-GM inequality, which states that for non-negative numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\),

\[
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}.
\]

Applying AM-GM to the terms \(\frac{c}{a}\), \(\frac{a}{b+c}\), and \(\frac{b}{c}\), we have:

\[
\frac{\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c}}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{a}{b+c} \cdot \frac{b}{c}}.
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
\sqrt[3]{\frac{c}{a} \cdot \frac{a}{b+c} \cdot \frac{b}{c}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{b}{b+c}}.
\]

Since \(\frac{b}{b+c} < 1\), it follows that:

\[
\sqrt[3]{\frac{b}{b+c}} < 1.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c}}{3} < 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} < 3.
\]

However, we need to compare this sum to 2, not 3. Let's consider specific values to test the inequality:

- **Example 1:** Let \(a = b = c = 1\).

  \[
  \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1+1} + \frac{1}{1} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + 1 = 2.5.
  \]

  Here, \(2.5 > 2\).

- **Example 2:** Let \(a = 1, b = 1, c = 2\).

  \[
  \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} = \frac{2}{1} + \frac{1}{1+2} + \frac{1}{2} = 2 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} = 2 + 0.333 + 0.5 = 2.833.
  \]

  Here, \(2.833 > 2\).

From these examples, it seems that the expression is generally greater than 2. Therefore, the correct inequality relation is:

\[
\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c} > 2.
\]

Thus, the answer is:

The answer is (E) $>$.
