## Response

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometry of the given configuration and find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality \( OD \cdot OE \cdot OF \geq C R^3 \) holds for all acute triangles \( ABC \).

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Configuration:**
   - \( O \) is the circumcenter of triangle \( ABC \).
   - \( D \) is the intersection of \( AO \) with the circumcircle of triangle \( OBC \).
   - \( E \) is the intersection of \( BO \) with the circumcircle of triangle \( OCA \).
   - \( F \) is the intersection of \( CO \) with the circumcircle of triangle \( OAB \).

2. **Properties of the Configuration:**
   - Since \( D \) lies on the circumcircle of \( OBC \), by the power of a point, we have \( OD \cdot OA = OB \cdot OC \).
   - Similarly, \( OE \cdot OB = OC \cdot OA \) and \( OF \cdot OC = OA \cdot OB \).

3. **Product of Distances:**
   - Multiply the three power of point equations:
     \[
     (OD \cdot OA) \cdot (OE \cdot OB) \cdot (OF \cdot OC) = (OB \cdot OC) \cdot (OC \cdot OA) \cdot (OA \cdot OB).
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     OD \cdot OE \cdot OF \cdot (OA \cdot OB \cdot OC) = (OA \cdot OB \cdot OC)^2.
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     OD \cdot OE \cdot OF = OA \cdot OB \cdot OC.
     \]

4. **Relating to the Circumradius \( R \):**
   - In an acute triangle, the circumradius \( R \) is related to the distances \( OA, OB, \) and \( OC \) as follows:
     \[
     OA = OB = OC = R.
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     OD \cdot OE \cdot OF = R \cdot R \cdot R = R^3.
     \]

5. **Finding the Largest Constant \( C \):**
   - From the above, we have shown that \( OD \cdot OE \cdot OF = R^3 \).
   - Therefore, the inequality \( OD \cdot OE \cdot OF \geq C R^3 \) holds with equality when \( C = 1 \).
   - Hence, the largest constant \( C \) for which the inequality holds for all acute triangles is \( C = 1 \).

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{1}\).

The answer is \( C = 1 \).
