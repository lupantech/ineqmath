## Response

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\frac{1}{n+1}\left(1+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2n-1}\right) \geq C \cdot \frac{1}{n}\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\right)
\]

holds for all natural numbers \( n \geq 2 \).

First, let's express the sums involved in the inequality:

1. The left-hand side sum is:
   \[
   S_1 = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2k-1} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2n-1}.
   \]

2. The right-hand side sum is:
   \[
   S_2 = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n}.
   \]

The inequality becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{n+1} S_1 \geq C \cdot \frac{1}{n} S_2.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
S_1 \geq C \cdot \frac{n+1}{n} S_2.
\]

To find \( C \), we need to compare \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \). Notice that each term in \( S_1 \) is smaller than the corresponding term in \( S_2 \) because:

\[
\frac{1}{2k-1} < \frac{1}{k}.
\]

However, the number of terms in \( S_1 \) is the same as in \( S_2 \), so \( S_1 < S_2 \).

To find a bound, consider the asymptotic behavior of these sums. The harmonic number \( H_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} \) is approximately \( \ln n + \gamma \), where \( \gamma \) is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. For the sum \( S_1 \), we have:

\[
S_1 \approx \frac{1}{2} \ln n + \text{constant terms}.
\]

Thus, asymptotically:

\[
S_1 \approx \frac{1}{2} S_2.
\]

This suggests that \( C \) should be close to \( \frac{1}{2} \). To verify, consider the inequality:

\[
S_1 \geq \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{n+1}{n} S_2.
\]

Simplifying, we need:

\[
S_1 \geq \frac{1}{2} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right) S_2.
\]

For large \( n \), \( S_1 \approx \frac{1}{2} S_2 \), and the factor \( \frac{1}{n} \) becomes negligible, suggesting \( C = \frac{1}{2} \) is indeed the largest constant satisfying the inequality for all \( n \geq 2 \).

Therefore, the largest constant \( C \) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}
\]

Thus, the answer is \( C = \frac{1}{2} \).
