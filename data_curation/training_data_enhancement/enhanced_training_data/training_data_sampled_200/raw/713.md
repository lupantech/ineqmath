## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths of a given triangle. Consider the following expressions:
$$
(a+b-c)(b+c-a)(c+a-b) \quad () \quad a b c
$$
Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
We have
$$
a^{2} \geq a^{2}-(b-c)^{2}=(a+b-c)(a+c-b)
$$

Analogously
$$
b^{2} \geq(b+a-c)(b+c-a) \quad \text { and } \quad c^{2} \geq(c+a-b)(c+b-a)
$$

If we multiply these inequalities we obtain
$$
\begin{aligned}
& a^{2} b^{2} c^{2} \geq(a+b-c)^{2}(b+c-a)^{2}(c+a-b)^{2} \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad a b c \geq(a+b-c)(b+c-a)(c+a-b)
\end{aligned}
$$

Equality holds if and only if $a=b=c$, i.e. the triangle is equilateral.2 After setting $a=x+y, b=y+z, c=z+x$, where $x, y, z>0$, the given inequality becomes
$$
(x+y)(y+z)(z+x) \geq 8 x y z
$$

Since $A M \geq G M$ we have
$$
(x+y)(y+z)(z+x) \geq 2 \sqrt{x y} \cdot 2 \sqrt{y z} \cdot 2 \sqrt{z x}=8 x y z
$$
as required. Equality occurs if and only if $x=y=z$ i.e. $a=b=c$. Therefore, the answer is (A) $\leq$.

## Expected Answer
(A) $\leq$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to compare the product of the three "excess" lengths
    (a+b−c),
    (b+c−a),
    (c+a−b)
with the product a·b·c, under the assumption that a,b,c are the side-lengths of a (nondegenerate) triangle.  In particular, each of a+b−c, b+c−a, c+a−b is positive, and the statement to be determined is

    (a+b−c)(b+c−a)(c+a−b)  □  a·b·c,

where □ is one of ≤, ≥, =, <, >.

We present two complementary proofs, both concluding that the correct relation is

    (a+b−c)(b+c−a)(c+a−b)  ≤  a·b·c,

with equality if and only if a=b=c (the equilateral case).

Proof 1 (Factorization and squares):

1.  Observe the identity
       (a+b−c)(a+c−b)
    =  a² + a(b−b) + (b−c)(c−b)
    =  a² −(b−c)².
   Since (b−c)² ≥0 for all real b,c, we deduce
       (a+b−c)(a+c−b)  =  a² −(b−c)²  ≤  a².
   Equivalently,
       a²  ≥  (a+b−c)(a+c−b).

2.  By perfect symmetry of the roles of a,b,c, we similarly obtain
       b²  ≥  (b+c−a)(b+a−c),
       c²  ≥  (c+a−b)(c+b−a).

3.  All factors on both sides of these three inequalities are nonnegative.  We multiply them together:
       a²·b²·c²  ≥  (a+b−c)(a+c−b)·(b+c−a)(b+a−c)·(c+a−b)(c+b−a)
                  =  [(a+b−c)(b+c−a)(c+a−b)]².

4.  Taking nonnegative square roots of both sides gives
       a·b·c  ≥  (a+b−c)(b+c−a)(c+a−b),
   or equivalently
       (a+b−c)(b+c−a)(c+a−b)  ≤  a·b·c.

5.  Equality in each of the three original inequalities a² ≥ (a+b−c)(a+c−b), etc., forces (b−c)²=0, (c−a)²=0, (a−b)²=0 simultaneously, hence a=b=c.  Thus equality holds if and only if the triangle is equilateral.

Proof 2 (Substitution and AM–GM):

1.  Since a,b,c form the sides of a triangle, one may set
       a = x+y,
       b = y+z,
       c = z+x,
   where x,y,z are positive real numbers.  Then
       a+b−c = (x+y)+(y+z)−(z+x) = 2y,
       b+c−a = 2z,
       c+a−b = 2x.
   Hence the left-hand product becomes
       (a+b−c)(b+c−a)(c+a−b)  =  (2y)(2z)(2x)  =  8xyz.
   Meanwhile,
       a·b·c  =  (x+y)(y+z)(z+x).
   The desired inequality is therefore
       (x+y)(y+z)(z+x)  ≥  8xyz.

2.  By the AM–GM inequality on each pair of positive numbers,
       x+y  ≥  2√(xy),
       y+z  ≥  2√(yz),
       z+x  ≥  2√(zx).
   Multiplying these three inequalities yields
       (x+y)(y+z)(z+x)  ≥  2√(xy)·2√(yz)·2√(zx)
                         =  8·√(x²y²z²)
                         =  8xyz.
   Hence
       (a+b−c)(b+c−a)(c+a−b)  =  8xyz  ≤  (x+y)(y+z)(z+x)  =  a·b·c.

3.  Equality in AM–GM holds exactly when x=y=z, which corresponds to a=b=c.  Thus again equality occurs only for the equilateral triangle.

Conclusion: In both proofs we arrive at the same inequality

    (a+b−c)(b+c−a)(c+a−b)  ≤  a·b·c,

with equality if and only if a=b=c.  Therefore, among the given options, the correct choice is

The answer is (A) ≤
