## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers. Consider the following inequality:
$$
a b \frac{a+c}{b+c} + b c \frac{b+a}{c+a} + c a \frac{c+b}{a+b} \quad () \quad \sqrt{3 a b c(a+b+c)} .
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
Let $x=\frac{1}{b c}, y=\frac{1}{a c}, z=\frac{1}{a b}$ and $A=a c, B=a b, C=b c$.
We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{x}{y+z}(B+C) & =a b \frac{a+c}{b+c}, \quad \frac{y}{z+x}(C+A)=b c \frac{b+a}{c+a} \quad \text { and } \\
\frac{z}{x+y}(A+B) & =c a \frac{c+b}{a+b}
\end{aligned}
$$

Using Corollary Let $a, b, c$ and $x, y, z$ be positive real numbers. Then
$$
\frac{x}{y+z}(b+c)+\frac{y}{z+x}(c+a)+\frac{z}{x+y}(a+b) \geq \sqrt{3(a b+b c+c a)}
$$
and the previous identities we obtain
$$
\begin{aligned}
& a b \frac{a+c}{b+c}+b c \frac{b+a}{c+a}+c a \frac{c+b}{a+b} \\
& \quad=\frac{x}{y+z}(B+C)+\frac{y}{z+x}(C+A)+\frac{z}{x+y}(A+B) \\
& \quad \geq \sqrt{3(A B+B C+C A)}=\sqrt{3 a b c(a+b+c)}
\end{aligned}
$$ Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to determine which relation “≤, ≥, =, <, >” correctly fills the blank in the inequality

  a b · (a + c)/(b + c)  (?)  √[3 a b c (a + b + c)],

where a, b, c are positive real numbers.  The original solution introduces a specific substitution that transforms the left‐hand side into a form amenable to a known symmetric inequality.  We now present a more detailed derivation, step by step.

Step 1.  Introduce auxiliary variables.

  Define x = 1/(b c),   y = 1/(a c),   z = 1/(a b),
  and define A = a c,   B = a b,   C = b c.

Observe that x, y, z are positive because a, b, c > 0.  Likewise A, B, C > 0.

Step 2.  Express each term a b·(a+c)/(b+c) etc. in terms of x, y, z and A, B, C.

  • Compute x/(y+z):
    y + z = 1/(a c) + 1/(a b) = (b + c)/(a b c).
    Hence
      x/(y+z)
      = [1/(b c)] / [(b + c)/(a b c)]
      = (1/(b c)) · (a b c/(b + c))
      = a/(b + c).
  • Also B + C = a b + b c = b(a + c).

  Therefore
    (x/(y+z))·(B + C)
    = [a/(b + c)] · [b(a + c)]
    = a b · (a + c)/(b + c).

  By exactly the same algebraic steps (cyclically permuting a,b,c and x,y,z), one obtains

    (y/(z + x))·(C + A) = b c · (b + a)/(c + a),

    (z/(x + y))·(A + B) = c a · (c + b)/(a + b).

Hence the entire left‐hand side of the original inequality can be written as

  a b·(a + c)/(b + c)
  + b c·(b + a)/(c + a)
  + c a·(c + b)/(a + b)

  = (x/(y+z))(B+C) + (y/(z+x))(C+A) + (z/(x+y))(A+B).

Step 3.  Apply the known symmetric inequality (a corollary of the Cauchy–Schwarz or Nesbitt‐type inequality).

Corollary.  For any positive reals a, b, c and x, y, z,

  (x/(y+z))(b+c) + (y/(z+x))(c+a) + (z/(x+y))(a+b)
  ≥ √[3 (a b + b c + c a)].

Proof sketch of corollary (for completeness):  One can use the Titu–Andreescu lemma or weighted AM–GM to show that each term x(b+c)/(y+z) 
  satisfies certain convexity properties, and then symmetrize.  The sharp constant √3 arises by testing equality when (a:b:c) is a permutation of (1:1:1) and (x:y:z) likewise.

Step 4.  Match the corollary’s parameters to our substitution.

  In the corollary’s notation, set a → A, b → B, c → C, and keep the same x, y, z as above.  Then b + c → B + C, etc.  Hence

    (x/(y+z))(B+C) + (y/(z+x))(C+A) + (z/(x+y))(A+B)
    ≥ √[3 (A B + B C + C A)].

But A B + B C + C A = (a c)(a b) + (a b)(b c) + (b c)(c a)
                   = a b c (a + b + c).

Thus

  a b · (a + c)/(b + c) + b c · (b + a)/(c + a) + c a · (c + b)/(a + b)
  ≥ √[3 a b c (a + b + c)].

Step 5.  Conclusion.

Comparing with the original inequality

  a b·(a + c)/(b + c)   (?)   √[3 a b c (a + b + c)],

we see that the correct relation is “≥”.

Therefore, the answer is (B) ≥
