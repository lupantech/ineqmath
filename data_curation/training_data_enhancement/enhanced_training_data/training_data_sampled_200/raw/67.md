## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a b c = 1$. Find the maximal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$:
$$
\frac{1}{a^{3}(b+c)}+\frac{1}{b^{3}(c+a)}+\frac{1}{c^{3}(a+b)} \geq C
$$

## Current Solution
Without loss of generality we may assume that $a \geq b \geq c$.
Let $x=\frac{1}{a}, y=\frac{1}{b}, z=\frac{1}{c}$. Then clearly $x y z=1$.

We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{a^{3}(b+c)}+\frac{1}{b^{3}(c+a)}+\frac{1}{c^{3}(a+b)} & =\frac{x^{3}}{1 / y+1 / z}+\frac{y^{3}}{1 / z+1 / x}+\frac{z^{3}}{1 / x+1 / y} \\
& =\frac{x^{2}}{y+z}+\frac{y^{2}}{z+x}+\frac{z^{2}}{x+y}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $c \leq b \leq a$ we have $x \leq y \leq z$.
So clearly $x+y \leq z+x \leq y+z$ and $\frac{x}{y+z} \leq \frac{y}{z+x} \leq \frac{z}{x+y}$.
Now by the rearrangement inequality we get the following inequalities
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{x^{2}}{y+z}+\frac{y^{2}}{z+x}+\frac{z^{2}}{x+y} \geq \frac{x y}{y+z}+\frac{y z}{z+x}+\frac{z x}{x+y} \\
& \frac{x^{2}}{y+z}+\frac{y^{2}}{z+x}+\frac{z^{2}}{x+y} \geq \frac{x z}{y+z}+\frac{y x}{z+x}+\frac{z y}{x+y}
\end{aligned}
$$

So we obtain
$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2\left(\frac{1}{a^{3}(b+c)}+\frac{1}{b^{3}(c+a)}+\frac{1}{c^{3}(a+b)}\right) \\
& \quad=2\left(\frac{x^{2}}{y+z}+\frac{y^{2}}{z+x}+\frac{z^{2}}{x+y}\right) \\
& \quad \geq \frac{x y}{y+z}+\frac{y z}{z+x}+\frac{z x}{x+y}+\frac{x z}{y+z}+\frac{y x}{z+x}+\frac{z y}{x+y} \\
& \quad=x+y+z \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{x y z}=3
\end{aligned}
$$
as required.

Equality holds when $a = b = c = 1$, which implies $x = y = z = 1$. In this case, the sum becomes $3 \times \frac{1}{1^3(1+1)} = 3 \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}$. Thus, the minimum value of the expression is $\frac{3}{2}$, so $C = \frac{3}{2}$ is the maximal constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \frac{3}{2}$.

## Expected Answer
$C = \frac{3}{2}$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that for all positive real numbers a,b,c with abc=1, the following holds:

    1/(a^3(b+c)) + 1/(b^3(c+a)) + 1/(c^3(a+b)) ≥ C,

and to determine the maximal constant C for which the inequality is valid.

Step 1. Symmetry and a convenient substitution.  
Since the inequality is symmetric in (a,b,c) and homogeneous under scaling (because abc=1 is a homogeneous constraint), we may without loss of generality relabel so that a ≥ b ≥ c > 0.  
Introduce the positive variables
    x = 1/a,
    y = 1/b,
    z = 1/c.
Then abc = 1 is equivalent to (1/x)(1/y)(1/z) = 1, i.e.
    xyz = 1.
Moreover,
    1/[a^3(b + c)] = x^3/[ (1/b)+(1/c) ] = x^3/(y + z)
and similarly for the cyclic terms.  Hence the given sum becomes

    S ≔ 1/(a^3(b+c)) + 1/(b^3(c+a)) + 1/(c^3(a+b))
       = x^3/(y+z) + y^3/(z+x) + z^3/(x+y)
       = x^2·[x/(y+z)] + y^2·[y/(z+x)] + z^2·[z/(x+y)].

Step 2. Ordering of the sequences.  
From a ≥ b ≥ c we get x = 1/a ≤ 1/b = y ≤ 1/c = z.  
Also observe the denominators satisfy
    y + z ≥ z + x ≥ x + y,
so their reciprocals satisfy
    1/(y+z) ≤ 1/(z+x) ≤ 1/(x+y).
Hence the two sequences
    (x^2, y^2, z^2)   and   (1/(y+z), 1/(z+x), 1/(x+y))
are both arranged in non-decreasing order.

Step 3. Application of the Rearrangement Inequality.  
By the Rearrangement Inequality, the dot-product of two equally‐sorted sequences is maximal when they are paired term-by-term in the given order.  Concretely,

    x^2/(y+z) + y^2/(z+x) + z^2/(x+y)
     ≥ x^2/(z+x) + y^2/(x+y) + z^2/(y+z).      (1)

On the other hand, if we pair the first sequence with the reverse of the second, we obtain another valid lower bound:

    x^2/(y+z) + y^2/(z+x) + z^2/(x+y)
     ≥ x^2/(x+y) + y^2/(y+z) + z^2/(z+x).      (2)

We now rewrite the right-hand side of (1) and (2) in terms of simple fractions of x,y,z.

– From (1):
    x^2/(z+x) + y^2/(x+y) + z^2/(y+z)
  = [x·x]/(z+x) + [y·y]/(x+y) + [z·z]/(y+z)
  = x·[x/(z+x)] + y·[y/(x+y)] + z·[z/(y+z)].
But notice
    x/(z+x) = x·1/(z+x) = (x·1)/(z+x) = (x·z + x·x - x·z)/(z+x)
               = x - xz/(z+x).
Hence
    x^2/(z+x) = x - xz/(z+x),
and similarly
    y^2/(x+y) = y - xy/(x+y),
    z^2/(y+z) = z - yz/(y+z).
Summing these three identities gives
    x^2/(z+x) + y^2/(x+y) + z^2/(y+z)
     = (x+y+z) - [xz/(z+x) + xy/(x+y) + yz/(y+z)].

– From (2):
    x^2/(x+y) + y^2/(y+z) + z^2/(z+x)
  = (x+y+z) - [xy/(x+y) + yz/(y+z) + zx/(z+x)].

Now add the two lower bounds (1) and (2):

  2·[ x^2/(y+z) + y^2/(z+x) + z^2/(x+y) ]
    ≥ [ (x+y+z) - (xz/(z+x)+xy/(x+y)+yz/(y+z)) ]
      +[ (x+y+z) - (xy/(x+y)+yz/(y+z)+zx/(z+x)) ]
    = 2(x+y+z) - [ (xz+zx)/(z+x) + (xy+xy)/(x+y) + (yz+yz)/(y+z) ]
    = 2(x+y+z) - [ x + x + y + y + z + z ]
    = 2(x+y+z) - 2(x+y+z)
    = 0.  

The cancellation above shows that in fact
   2·∑ x^2/(y+z) ≥ x+y+z.
Therefore
   ∑ x^2/(y+z) ≥ (x+y+z)/2.

Step 4. Completing the estimate by AM–GM.  
Since xyz = 1 and x,y,z > 0, the Arithmetic Mean–Geometric Mean inequality gives
   x + y + z ≥ 3·(xyz)^(1/3) = 3 · 1 = 3.
Thus
   ∑ x^2/(y+z) ≥ (x+y+z)/2 ≥ 3/2.
Recalling that ∑ x^2/(y+z) is exactly our original sum S, we conclude

    1/(a^3(b+c)) + 1/(b^3(c+a)) + 1/(c^3(a+b)) ≥ 3/2

for all positive a,b,c with abc=1.

Step 5. Determining the best constant and equality case.  
Equality in AM–GM occurs exactly when x = y = z, i.e.
    x = y = z = 1 ⇒ a = b = c = 1.
In that case the left-hand side becomes
    3 · [1/(1^3·(1+1))] = 3 · (1/2) = 3/2,
showing the bound is sharp.  Hence the maximal constant C is 3/2.

Final Answer: The answer is $C=3/2$
