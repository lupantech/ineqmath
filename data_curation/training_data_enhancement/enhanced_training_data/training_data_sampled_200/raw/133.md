## Problem
Let $a, b, c > 1$ be positive real numbers such that $\frac{1}{a^{2}-1}+\frac{1}{b^{2}-1}+\frac{1}{c^{2}-1}=1$. Find the smallest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{1}{a+1}+\frac{1}{b+1}+\frac{1}{c+1} \leq C
$$

## Current Solution
Without loss of generality we may assume that $a \geq b \geq c$. Then we have
$$
\frac{a-2}{a+1} \geq \frac{b-2}{b+1} \geq \frac{c-2}{c+1} \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{a+2}{a-1} \leq \frac{b+2}{b-1} \leq \frac{c+2}{c-1}
$$

Now by Chebishev's inequality we get
$$
\begin{aligned}
3\left(\frac{a^{2}-4}{a^{2}-1}+\frac{b^{2}-4}{b^{2}-1}+\frac{c^{2}-4}{c^{2}-1}\right) \leq & \left(\frac{a-2}{a+1}+\frac{b-2}{b+1}+\frac{c-2}{c+1}\right) \\
& \times\left(\frac{a+2}{a-1}+\frac{b+2}{b-1}+\frac{c+2}{c-1}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Since
$$
\frac{a^{2}-4}{a^{2}-1}+\frac{b^{2}-4}{b^{2}-1}+\frac{c^{2}-4}{c^{2}-1}=3-3\left(\frac{1}{a^{2}-1}+\frac{1}{b^{2}-1}+\frac{1}{c^{2}-1}\right)=0
$$
and
$$
\frac{a+2}{a-1}+\frac{b+2}{b-1}+\frac{c+2}{c-1}>0
$$
we must have
$$
\frac{a-2}{a+1}+\frac{b-2}{b+1}+\frac{c-2}{c+1} \geq 0
$$
which is equivalent to $\frac{1}{a+1}+\frac{1}{b+1}+\frac{1}{c+1} \leq 1$, as required.
Equality holds iff $a=b=c=2$.

Equality is achieved when $a = b = c = 2$, since then $\frac{1}{a^{2}-1}+\frac{1}{b^{2}-1}+\frac{1}{c^{2}-1} = 3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1$ and $\frac{1}{a+1}+\frac{1}{b+1}+\frac{1}{c+1} = 3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1$. This gives the maximum value of the sum, so the smallest constant $C$ for which the inequality always holds is $C = 1$.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 1$. 

## Expected Answer
$C = 1$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that under the constraint
  (1) 1\/(a²−1)+1\/(b²−1)+1\/(c²−1)=1,
with a,b,c>1, the maximum possible value of
  S=1\/(a+1)+1\/(b+1)+1\/(c+1)
is 1.  Equivalently, we must prove S≤1 and that equality occurs exactly when a=b=c=2.  We follow the same approach as in the original solution but fill in all logical and computational details.

Step 1.  Symmetry and ordering.
Because the three variables enter the constraints symmetrically, we may assume without loss of generality that
  a ≥ b ≥ c > 1.

Step 2.  Definition of two sequences and their monotonicity.
Define two real‐valued functions for t>1:
  f(t)=(t−2)/(t+1),
  g(t)=(t+2)/(t−1).
We check their derivatives to determine monotonicity:
  f′(t)=[(1)(t+1)−(t−2)(1)]/(t+1)²=[t+1−t+2]/(t+1)²=3/(t+1)²>0,
so f is strictly increasing on (1,∞).  Similarly,
  g′(t)=[(1)(t−1)−(t+2)(1)]/(t−1)²=[t−1−t−2]/(t−1)²=−3/(t−1)²<0,
so g is strictly decreasing on (1,∞).

Because a≥b≥c, we obtain the chain of inequalities
  f(a) ≥ f(b) ≥ f(c),
  g(a) ≤ g(b) ≤ g(c).

Step 3.  Application of Chebyshev’s inequality.
Chebyshev’s inequality for three real numbers states that if x₁≥x₂≥x₃ and y₁≤y₂≤y₃, then
  (1/3)(x₁y₁+x₂y₂+x₃y₃) ≤ [(1/3)(x₁+x₂+x₃)]·[(1/3)(y₁+y₂+y₃)].
Multiply both sides by 9 to obtain the equivalent form
  3·(x₁y₁+x₂y₂+x₃y₃) ≤ (x₁+x₂+x₃)(y₁+y₂+y₃).

We now set
  x₁=f(a),  x₂=f(b),  x₃=f(c),
  y₁=g(a),  y₂=g(b),  y₃=g(c).
Then by the chains established above, Chebyshev yields
  3·[f(a)g(a)+f(b)g(b)+f(c)g(c)] ≤ [f(a)+f(b)+f(c)]·[g(a)+g(b)+g(c)].

Step 4.  Simplify f(t)·g(t).
Compute for any t>1:
  f(t)·g(t)=((t−2)/(t+1))·((t+2)/(t−1))=(t²−4)/(t²−1).
Hence
  f(a)g(a)+f(b)g(b)+f(c)g(c)= (a²−4)/(a²−1)+(b²−4)/(b²−1)+(c²−4)/(c²−1).

Step 5.  Use the given constraint to evaluate the sum of (t²−4)/(t²−1).
Observe that for t>1,
  (t²−4)/(t²−1)=1−3/(t²−1).
Therefore
  ∑_{t∈{a,b,c}}(t²−4)/(t²−1)=∑[1−3/(t²−1)]
   =3 − 3·[1/(a²−1)+1/(b²−1)+1/(c²−1)].
By the hypothesis (1), the bracketed sum is 1, so
  f(a)g(a)+f(b)g(b)+f(c)g(c)=3−3·1=0.

Step 6.  Combine with Chebyshev’s inequality.
From Step 3 we have
  3·0 ≤ [f(a)+f(b)+f(c)]·[g(a)+g(b)+g(c)],
so
  0 ≤ [f(a)+f(b)+f(c)]·[g(a)+g(b)+g(c)].
Since each term g(t)=(t+2)/(t−1) is strictly positive for t>1, their sum is positive.  Hence we can divide by g(a)+g(b)+g(c) and conclude
  f(a)+f(b)+f(c) ≥ 0.

Step 7.  Translate back to the desired sum S.
By definition,
  f(a)+f(b)+f(c)=∑(t−2)/(t+1)
   =∑[(t+1−3)/(t+1)]
   =∑[1 − 3/(t+1)]
   =3 − 3·[1/(a+1)+1/(b+1)+1/(c+1)].
Thus f(a)+f(b)+f(c)≥0 is equivalent to
  3−3·S ≥ 0  ⇔  S ≤ 1.

Step 8.  Conclusion and sharpness.
We have shown that for all a,b,c>1 satisfying the constraint (1),
  1/(a+1)+1/(b+1)+1/(c+1) ≤ 1.
Moreover, equality in Chebyshev’s inequality requires x₁:x₂:x₃=y₁:y₂:y₃, which here forces a=b=c.  Substituting a=b=c into the constraint 1/(a²−1)+1/(a²−1)+1/(a²−1)=1 gives 3/(a²−1)=1, so a²−1=3 and a=2.  Hence equality occurs exactly when a=b=c=2.

Therefore the smallest constant C for which the inequality always holds is

The answer is $C=1$
