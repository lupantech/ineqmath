## Problem
Let $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$ be non-negative real numbers such that $x_{1} + x_{2} + \cdots + x_{n} \leq \frac{1}{2}$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\left(1 - x_{1}\right)\left(1 - x_{2}\right) \cdots \left(1 - x_{n}\right) \geq C
$$

## Current Solution
From $x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n} \leq \frac{1}{2}$ and the fact that $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$ are nonnegative we deduce that
$$
0 \leq x_{i} \leq \frac{1}{2}<1, \quad \text { i.e. } \quad-x_{i}>-1, \quad \text { for all } i=1,2, \ldots, n
$$
and it's clear that all $-x_{i}$ are of the same sign.
We obtain
$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(1-x_{1}\right)\left(1-x_{2}\right) \cdots\left(1-x_{n}\right) & =\left(1+\left(-x_{1}\right)\right)\left(1+\left(-x_{2}\right)\right) \cdots\left(1+\left(-x_{n}\right)\right) \\
& \geq 1+\left(-x_{1}-x_{2}-\cdots-x_{n}\right) \\
& =1-\left(x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}\right) \geq 1-\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
Equality holds when $x_1 = \frac{1}{2}$ and $x_2 = x_3 = \cdots = x_n = 0$. This gives the minimum value of the product, so $C = \frac{1}{2}$ is the largest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \frac{1}{2}$.

## Expected Answer
$C = \frac{1}{2}$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to find the largest constant C such that for any nonnegative real numbers x₁,…,xₙ with x₁+⋯+xₙ ≤ 1/2, the product

    (1−x₁)(1−x₂)⋯(1−xₙ)

is bounded below by C.  We will show by a careful application of a product‐version of Bernoulli’s inequality that

    (1−x₁)(1−x₂)⋯(1−xₙ) ≥ 1 − (x₁+⋯+xₙ) ≥ 1 − 1/2 = 1/2,

and that this bound is sharp (so C = 1/2).

Step 1.  Bound each xᵢ.
Since x₁,…,xₙ are nonnegative and their sum is at most 1/2, each xᵢ satisfies

    0 ≤ xᵢ ≤ x₁+⋯+xₙ ≤ 1/2 < 1.

Hence 1−xᵢ > 0 for every i.

Step 2.  Set a convenient notation.
Define aᵢ = −xᵢ for i = 1,…,n.  Then each aᵢ lies in the interval [−1,0], and all the aᵢ’s are nonpositive (i.e. of the same sign).  Moreover,

    ∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ = −∑_{i=1}ⁿ xᵢ ≥ −1/2.

In these terms,

    1 − xᵢ = 1 + aᵢ,   so   (1−x₁)…(1−xₙ) = ∏_{i=1}ⁿ (1 + aᵢ).

Step 3.  Apply the product‐version of Bernoulli’s inequality.
We claim that whenever a₁,…,aₙ ≥ −1 and all have the same sign, one has

    ∏_{i=1}ⁿ(1 + aᵢ) ≥ 1 + ∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ.

Proof (by induction):
• Base case n=1 is trivial: ∏(1 + a₁)=1 + a₁.
• Inductive step: assume for n factors
      ∏_{i=1}ⁿ(1 + aᵢ) ≥ 1 + ∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ.
  Then multiplying by (1 + aₙ₊₁) gives

    ∏_{i=1}^{n+1}(1 + aᵢ) = (∏_{i=1}ⁿ(1 + aᵢ))·(1 + aₙ₊₁)
      ≥ (1 + ∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ)(1 + aₙ₊₁)
      = 1 + ∑_{i=1}^{n+1} aᵢ + igl(∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢigr)aₙ₊₁.

  Since each aᵢ ≤ 0, both ∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ ≤ 0 and aₙ₊₁ ≤ 0, so their product is ≥0.  Hence

    ∏_{i=1}^{n+1}(1 + aᵢ) ≥ 1 + ∑_{i=1}^{n+1} aᵢ,

  completing the induction.

Step 4.  Conclude the lower bound.
Applying this to aᵢ = −xᵢ gives

    (1−x₁)…(1−xₙ) = ∏(1 + aᵢ) ≥ 1 + ∑aᵢ = 1 − (x₁+…+xₙ) ≥ 1 − 1/2 = 1/2.

Thus the product is always at least 1/2.

Step 5.  Show sharpness.
Equality in the product‐Bernoulli step holds exactly when at most one of the aᵢ is nonzero, i.e. at most one xᵢ>0.  To make 1 − (x₁+⋯+xₙ) minimal under the constraint ∑xᵢ ≤ 1/2, we take one variable equal to 1/2 and the rest zero.  Then the product is exactly 1−1/2 = 1/2.

Hence the largest possible constant C for which

    (1−x₁)…(1−xₙ) ≥ C

always holds is C = 1/2.

The answer is $C=\tfrac12$
