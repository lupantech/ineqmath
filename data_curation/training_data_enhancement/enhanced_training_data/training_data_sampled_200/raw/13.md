## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be non-negative real numbers. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}_0$:
$$
a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}+a b c \geq C(a+b+c)^{3}
$$

## Current Solution
We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
(a+b+c)^{3} & =a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}+3\left(a^{2}(b+c)+b^{2}(c+a)+c^{2}(a+b)\right)+6 a b c \\
& =\frac{T[3,0,0]}{2}+3 T[2,1,0]+T[1,1,1]
\end{aligned}
$$
and
$$
a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}+a b c=\frac{T[3,0,0]}{2}+\frac{T[1,1,1]}{6}
$$

So we need to prove that
$$
7\left(\frac{T[3,0,0]}{2}+\frac{T[1,1,1]}{6}\right) \geq \frac{T[3,0,0]}{2}+3 T[2,1,0]+T[1,1,1]
$$
i.e.
$$
3 T[3,0,0]+\frac{T[1,1,1]}{6} \geq 3 T[2,1,0]
$$
which is true according to $T[3,0,0] \geq T[2,1,0]$ and $T[1,1,1] \geq 0$ (Muirhead's theorem).

Equality holds when $a = b = c$, since then all symmetric sums are equal and the inequality becomes an equality. This gives the minimum value of $C$, so $C = \frac{1}{7}$ is the largest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \frac{1}{7}$.

## Expected Answer
$C = \frac{1}{7}$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to find the maximal real constant C such that for all nonnegative a,b,c,

  a³ + b³ + c³ + a b c  ≥  C⋅(a + b + c)³.

Our approach is to rewrite both sides in terms of standard symmetric sums of a,b,c and then compare term by term.

1.  Notation (full symmetric sums).  For any triple of nonnegative integers (α,β,γ), define

   T[α,β,γ]  =  ∑_{all permutations of (α,β,γ)}  a^α b^β c^γ.

   In particular:
   •  T[3,0,0] = a³ + b³ + c³   (there are exactly three permutations of (3,0,0)),
   •  T[2,1,0] = a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b  (six permutations),
   •  T[1,1,1] = 6·(a b c)  (six identical terms).

2.  Expansion of (a + b + c)³.  A direct expansion gives

   (a + b + c)³  =  a³ + b³ + c³
                 + 3·(a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b)
                 + 6·(a b c)
               =  T[3,0,0]
                 + 3·T[2,1,0]
                 +   T[1,1,1].

3.  Expression for the left–hand side.  Similarly,

   a³ + b³ + c³ + a b c
 =  T[3,0,0]   +  (1/6)·T[1,1,1],

   since T[1,1,1] = 6·a b c.

4.  Reformulation of the inequality.  The claim

      a³ + b³ + c³ + a b c  ≥  C·(a + b + c)³

   becomes, in the language of symmetric sums,

     T[3,0,0]  +  (1/6)·T[1,1,1]
     ≥  C·[ T[3,0,0]  + 3·T[2,1,0]  +  T[1,1,1] ].

5.  Clearing denominators.  Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate fractions:

    6·T[3,0,0]  +  T[1,1,1]
    ≥ 6C·T[3,0,0]  + 18C·T[2,1,0]  + 6C·T[1,1,1].

   Rearranging all terms to the left gives

    (6 − 6C)·T[3,0,0]
    − 18C·T[2,1,0]
    + (1 − 6C)·T[1,1,1]
    ≥  0.

6.  Specializing to C = 1/7.  We claim that when C = 1/7, the left–hand side is a sum of two nonnegative quantities:

    •  Coefficient of T[3,0,0] − T[2,1,0]:
       6 − 6C  = 6 − 6/7  = 36/7,
       so  (6−6C)·T[3,0,0]  − 18C·T[2,1,0]
       =  (36/7)·T[3,0,0]  − (18/7)·T[2,1,0]
       =  (18/7)·(2·T[3,0,0] − T[2,1,0]).

       By Muirhead’s theorem, the exponent triple (3,0,0) majorizes (2,1,0),
       so the fully symmetric sum T[3,0,0] ≥ T[2,1,0].  Hence

         2·T[3,0,0]  −  T[2,1,0]  ≥  T[3,0,0]  ≥ 0,

       and thus  (18/7)·(2T[3,0,0]−T[2,1,0]) ≥ 0.

    •  Coefficient of T[1,1,1]:
       1 − 6C  = 1 − 6/7  = 1/7  ≥ 0,
       and since T[1,1,1] = 6abc ≥ 0, we have

         (1−6C)·T[1,1,1]  =  (1/7)·T[1,1,1]  ≥  0.

   Summing these two nonnegative pieces shows the entire left–hand side is ≥0.  In other words,

     7·(a³ + b³ + c³ + a b c)
     ≥  (a + b + c)³

   for all nonnegative a,b,c.  Equivalently,

     a³ + b³ + c³ + a b c
     ≥  (1/7)·(a + b + c)³.

7.  Optimality of C = 1/7.  If we tried any C′ > 1/7, then set a = b = c = 1 to obtain

     3·1³ + 1·1·1  = 4
     <  C′·(1 + 1 + 1)³  = 27·C′

   because 4 < 27·C′ whenever C′ > 4/27, and in particular whenever C′ > 1/7.  Thus no larger constant than 1/7 can work in all cases.

Conclusion.  The largest constant C for which

   a³ + b³ + c³ + a b c  ≥  C·(a + b + c)³  

holds for every nonnegative a,b,c is

   C = 1/7.

Therefore, The answer is $C=\frac{1}{7}$.
