Rewrite the inequality in an exponent-normalized form.\n\n  Observe that both sides are raised to the power S = a + b + c.  Hence, it suffices to prove\n\n    (a^b · b^c · c^a)^(1/S)  ≤  C · S.\n\nStep 2.  Apply the weighted AM–GM inequality.\n\n  We view (a^b · b^c · c^a)^(1/S) as a weighted geometric mean of the numbers a, b, c with weights\n\n    w₁ = b/S,   w₂ = c/S,   w₃ = a/S,\n\n  which indeed satisfy w₁ + w₂ + w₃ = 1 and w₁, w₂, w₃ ≥ 0.  The weighted AM–GM inequality states:\n\n    a^(w₁) · b^(w₂) · c^(w₃)\n      ≤  w₁·a + w₂·b + w₃·c.\n\n  Therefore,\n\n    (a^b · b^c · c^a)^(1/S)\n      = a^(b/S) · b^(c/S) · c^(a/S)\n      ≤ (b/S)·a + (c/S)·b + (a/S)·c\n      = (ab + bc + ca)/S.

Bound the symmetric sum ab + bc + ca.\n\n  A well-known inequality for any real a, b, c is\n\n    ab + bc + ca  ≤  (a + b + c)² / 3  =  S² / 3.\n\n  Substituting into (1) gives\n\n    (a^b · b^c · c^a)^(1/S)\n      ≤ (S² / 3) / S  =  S/3.\n\nHence we have shown for all a, b, c > 0,\n\n    (a^b · b^c · c^a)^(1/S) ≤ S/3,\n\nand raising both sides to the power S yields\n\n    a^b · b^c · c^a  ≤  (S/3)^S  =  [ (1/3)·S ]^S  =  [ C·S ]^S  with C = 1/3.\n\nStep 4.  Verify minimality of C.\n\n  Equality in the weighted AM–GM step occurs precisely when a = b = c, and equality in ab + bc + ca ≤ S²/3 also requires a = b = c.  Set a = b = c; then S = 3a, and the original inequality becomes\n\n    (a^a · a^a · a^a)  =  a^{3a}\n      ≤ [C·(3a)]^{3a}  =  (3C a)^{3a}.\n\n  For this to hold for all a > 0, we need  a^{3a} ≤ (3C a)^{3a}, i.e.\n\n    1  ≤  (3C)^{3a}  for every a > 0.\n\n  This forces 3C ≥ 1, so C ≥ 1/3.
