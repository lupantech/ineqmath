Setting up Hölder’s Inequality.\n\nWe recall the following form of Hölder’s inequality for three nonnegative sequences \\{x_j\\}, \\{y_j\\}, \\{z_j\\}:\n\n   (∑_{j=1}^n x_j)^{1/3}\n   (∑_{j=1}^n y_j)^{1/3}\n   (∑_{j=1}^n z_j)^{1/3}\n≥ ∑_{j=1}^n (x_j)^{1/3}(y_j)^{1/3}(z_j)^{1/3}.\n\nWe apply this with n = 3 and the index j running over the three values corresponding to the variables a, b, c.  Define\n\n   x_1 = a^a,\n   x_2 = b^a,\n   x_3 = c^a,\n\n   y_1 = a^b,\n   y_2 = b^b,\n   y_3 = c^b,\n\n   z_1 = a^c,\n   z_2 = b^c,\n   z_3 = c^c.\n\nBy construction, each sum ∑ x_j = a^a + b^a + c^a, and similarly for ∑ y_j, ∑ z_j.\n\nStep 2.  Computing the right‐hand side inside the sum.\n\nFor each j ∈ {1,2,3}, we have\n\n   (x_j)^{1/3}(y_j)^{1/3}(z_j)^{1/3}\n = (a_j^a)^{1/3} · (a_j^b)^{1/3} · (a_j^c)^{1/3}\n = a_j^{(a + b + c)/3},\n\nwhere we write a_1 = a, a_2 = b, a_3 = c.  Since a + b + c = 1 by hypothesis, this exponent becomes 1/3, so\n\n   (x_j)^{1/3}(y_j)^{1/3}(z_j)^{1/3} = a_j^{1/3}.\n\nHence the sum on the right of Hölder is\n\n   ∑_{j=1}^3 (x_j)^{1/3}(y_j)^{1/3}(z_j)^{1/3}\n = a^{1/3} + b^{1/3} + c^{1/3}.\n\nStep 3.  Applying Hölder and simplifying.\n\nBy Hölder,\n\n   (a^a + b^a + c^a)^{1/3}\n   (a^b + b^b + c^b)^{1/3}\n   (a^c + b^c + c^c)^{1/3}\n ≥ a^{1/3} + b^{1/3} + c^{1/3}.\n\nRaising both sides to the third power (which preserves the inequality since all expressions are positive) gives\n\n   (a^a + b^a + c^a)\n   (a^b + b^b + c^b)\n   (a^c + b^c + c^c)\n ≥ \\bigl(a^{1/3} + b^{1/3} + c^{1/3}\\bigr)^3.\n\nThus the inequality holds with C = 1.\n\nStep 4.  Verifying sharpness of C = 1.\n\nEquality in Hölder’s inequality occurs precisely when the three sequences \\{x_j\\}, \\{y_j\\}, \\{z_j\\} are proportional term‐by‐term.  Here that condition reduces to\n\n   a^a : a^b : a^c  =  b^a : b^b : b^c  =  c^a : c^b : c^c.\n\nOne checks that this can happen only when a = b = c.  Under the constraint a + b + c = 1, this forces a = b = c = 1/3.  Substituting a = b = c = 1/3 into both sides of the original inequality shows they coincide, confirming that C cannot be taken larger than 1.\n\nConclusion.  The largest constant C for which the given inequality holds for all positive a, b, c summing to 1 is\n\nThe answer is $C = 1$",
