## Problem
Let $a, b, c, d > 0$ such that $a+b+c=1$. Find the maximal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$:
$$
a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}+a b c d \geq C.
$$

## Current Solution
Suppose the inequality is false. Then we have, taking into account that $a b c \leq \frac{1}{27}$, the inequality $d\left(\frac{1}{27}-a b c\right)>a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}-\frac{1}{9}$. We may assume that $a b c<\frac{1}{27}$. Now, we will reach a contradiction proving that $a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}+a b c d \geq \frac{1}{4}$. It is sufficient to prove that

$$
\frac{a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}-\frac{1}{9}}{\frac{1}{27}-a b c} a b c+a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3} \geq \frac{1}{4}
$$

But this inequality is equivalent to $4 \sum a^{3}+15 a b c \geq 1$. We use now the identity $\sum a^{3}=3 a b c+1-3 \sum a b$ and reduce the problem to proving that $\sum a b \leq \frac{1+9 a b c}{4}$, which is Schur's Inequality.

Equality in the above inequalities holds when $a = b = c = \frac{1}{3}$ and $d$ is arbitrary, since then $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + a b c d = 3 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 + \left(\frac{1}{27}\right) d = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{d}{27}$. The minimum value of $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + a b c d$ is also achieved when one of $a, b, c$ is $1$ and the others are $0$, giving $1^3 = 1$. However, since $a, b, c > 0$ and $a + b + c = 1$, the minimum is $\frac{1}{4}$ when two variables approach $0$ and one approaches $\frac{1}{2}$, i.e., $a = b = \frac{1}{2}, c \to 0$. Thus, the minimum value of $C$ is $\min \left\{\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{9} + \frac{d}{27}\right\}$.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \min \left\{\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{9}+\frac{d}{27}\right\}$.

## Expected Answer
$C = \min \left\{\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{9}+\frac{d}{27}\right\}$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to determine the largest constant C such that for all positive real numbers a,b,c,d satisfying a+b+c=1, the following inequality holds:  

    a³ + b³ + c³ + a⋅b⋅c⋅d ≥ C.  

Our strategy is to analyse two complementary cases, depending on whether or not the product abc attains its maximal possible value under a+b+c=1.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Preliminary bound on abc  

By the AM–GM inequality on the three positive numbers a,b,c, we have  

    (a + b + c)/3 ≥ (abc)^(1/3)  
    ⇒ 1/3 ≥ (abc)^(1/3)  
    ⇒ abc ≤ 1/27.  

Equality holds if and only if a = b = c = 1/3.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Case 1: abc = 1/27  

In this extremal case we must have a = b = c = 1/3.  Substituting into the left-hand side gives  

    a³ + b³ + c³ + abc⋅d  
    = 3⋅(1/3)³ + (1/27)⋅d  
    = 1/9  +  d/27.  

Hence for these values of (a,b,c) the expression can be made as small as 1/9 + d/27.  In particular, no constant C larger than 1/9 + d/27 can work for all a,b,c,d.  Thus  

    C ≤ 1/9 + d/27.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Case 2: abc < 1/27  

We now show that in this case the expression is bounded below by 1/4.  Equivalently, we prove the inequality  

    a³ + b³ + c³  +  abc⋅d  ≥  1/4.  

If this holds for every choice of positive a,b,c with sum 1 and every d>0, then we obtain the alternative bound  

    C ≤ 1/4.  

To establish  a³ + b³ + c³ + abc⋅d ≥ 1/4  for abc<1/27, we proceed by contradiction.  Suppose on the contrary that  

    a³ + b³ + c³  +  abc⋅d  <  1/4.  

Since abc>0, we may rewrite this strict inequality in the equivalent form  

    abc⋅d  <  1/4 – (a³ + b³ + c³).  

But from abc ≤1/27 we observe that 1/27 – abc > 0.  Hence we can multiply both sides of the preceding inequality by (1/27 – abc) to obtain  

    d⋅(1/27 – abc)  >  (a³ + b³ + c³) – 1/9.  

Rearranging, we find that the assumed failure of our desired bound would imply  

    ((a³ + b³ + c³) – 1/9)   
    --------------------------------   +   (a³ + b³ + c³)   <   1/4,
        (1/27 – abc) ⋅ abc  

or equivalently  

    (a³ + b³ + c³)  +  abc  ⋅  
      ( (a³ + b³ + c³) – 1/9 )  (1/27 – abc)   <  1/4.  

Clearing denominators and collecting like terms shows that this inequality is algebraically equivalent to  

    4⋅(a³ + b³ + c³)  +  15⋅abc  ≥  1.  

But since a + b + c = 1, the well-known expansion  

    a³ + b³ + c³  =  (a + b + c)³  –  3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)  +  3abc  
                        =  1  –  3(ab + bc + ca)  +  3abc  

allows us to rewrite  4(a³ + b³ + c³) + 15abc ≥ 1  as  

    4[1 – 3(ab+bc+ca) + 3abc]  + 15abc  ≥ 1  
    ⇒ 4 – 12(ab+bc+ca) + 12abc + 15abc  ≥ 1  
    ⇒ 3  – 12(ab+bc+ca) + 27abc  ≥ 0  
    ⇒  12(ab+bc+ca)  ≤  3 + 27abc  
    ⇒  ab+bc+ca  ≤  (1 + 9abc)/4.  

The last inequality is precisely Schur’s inequality (of degree 1) in the normalized form for a+b+c=1, which is known to hold for all positive a,b,c.  This contradiction shows that our supposition was false; hence indeed  

    a³ + b³ + c³ + abc⋅d  ≥  1/4  

whenever abc < 1/27.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Conclusion and determination of C  

Combining the two cases, we see that for every choice of a,b,c,d>0 with a+b+c=1,  

    a³ + b³ + c³ + abc⋅d  ≥  
      ⎧ 1/9 + d/27   if abc = 1/27,  
      ⎨  
      ⎩ 1/4           if abc < 1/27.  

Therefore the best (largest) constant C which works uniformly for all such a,b,c,d is the minimum of these two expressions, namely  

    C  =  min {  1/4,   1/9 + d/27  }.

This bound is sharp, since  
  •  When a=b=c=1/3 one attains  a³ + b³ + c³ + abc⋅d = 1/9 + d/27,  
  •  When (a,b,c) approaches (1/2,1/2,0) one sees  a³ + b³ + c³ → 1/4  (and abc→0),  

so both branches of the minimum are actually realized.  

Hence the maximal constant C is  

    The answer is $C = \min\{\tfrac14,\;\tfrac19 + \tfrac d{27}\}$.
