## Problem
Let $a, b, c, d > 0$ be real numbers such that $a \leq 1$, $a+b \leq 5$, $a+b+c \leq 14$, and $a+b+c+d \leq 30$. Find the smallest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$ satisfying the given constraints:
$$
\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+\sqrt{d} \leq C
$$

## Current Solution
The function $f:(0,+\infty) \rightarrow(0,+\infty)$ defined by $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ is concave on $(0,+\infty)$, so by Jensen's inequality, for
$$
n=4, \quad \alpha_{1}=\frac{1}{10}, \quad \alpha_{2}=\frac{2}{10}, \quad \alpha_{3}=\frac{3}{10}, \quad \alpha_{4}=\frac{4}{10}
$$
we get
$$
\frac{1}{10} \sqrt{a}+\frac{2}{10} \sqrt{\frac{b}{4}}+\frac{3}{10} \sqrt{\frac{c}{9}}+\frac{4}{10} \sqrt{\frac{d}{16}} \leq \sqrt{\frac{a}{10}+\frac{b}{20}+\frac{c}{30}+\frac{d}{40}}
$$
i.e.
$$
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+\sqrt{d} \leq 10 \sqrt{\frac{12 a+6 b+4 c+3 d}{120}} \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

On the other hand, we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
& 12 a+6 b+4 c+3 d \\
& \quad=3(a+b+c+d)+(a+b+c)+2(a+b)+6 a \\
& \quad \leq 3 \cdot 30+14+2 \cdot 5+6 \cdot 1=120
\end{aligned}
$$

By (1) and the last inequality we obtain the required result.

Equality holds when $a = 1$, $b = 4$, $c = 9$, $d = 16$, since these values satisfy all the constraints with equality and yield $\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}+\sqrt{d} = 1+2+3+4 = 10$. This gives the maximum value of the sum, so $C = 10$ is the smallest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 10$. 

## Expected Answer
$C = 10$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that among all positive real 4-tuples (a,b,c,d) satisfying
a ≤ 1,
 a + b ≤ 5,
 a + b + c ≤ 14,
 a + b + c + d ≤ 30,
 the maximum possible value of S = √a + √b + √c + √d is 10.  Equivalently, we must prove

  √a + √b + √c + √d ≤ C

for all admissible (a,b,c,d), and identify the smallest such constant C.

1.  Introducing the concave function and Jensen’s inequality
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Let f(x) = √x, which is concave on (0, ∞) since f″(x) = −(1/4)x^(−3/2) < 0.  For any nonnegative weights α₁, …, α₄ with α₁+⋯+α₄ = 1 and any positive inputs x₁, …, x₄, Jensen’s inequality gives

  α₁ f(x₁) + α₂ f(x₂) + α₃ f(x₃) + α₄ f(x₄)
    ≤ f( α₁ x₁ + α₂ x₂ + α₃ x₃ + α₄ x₄ ).

We will choose specific weights and inputs so that the left side becomes exactly (1/10)√a + (2/10)√(b/4) + (3/10)√(c/9) + (4/10)√(d/16), which upon a suitable scaling reproduces √a + √b + √c + √d.

2.  Choice of weights and rescaling of variables
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Set

  α₁ = 1/10,
  α₂ = 2/10,
  α₃ = 3/10,
  α₄ = 4/10.

Clearly α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = (1+2+3+4)/10 = 1.  Define scaled arguments

  x₁ = a,
  x₂ = b/4,
  x₃ = c/9,
  x₄ = d/16.

Then:
  f(x₁) = √a,
  f(x₂) = √(b/4) = (1/2)√b,
  f(x₃) = √(c/9) = (1/3)√c,
  f(x₄) = √(d/16) = (1/4)√d.

Hence

  α₁ f(x₁) + α₂ f(x₂) + α₃ f(x₃) + α₄ f(x₄)
    = (1/10)√a + (2/10)(1/2)√b + (3/10)(1/3)√c + (4/10)(1/4)√d
    = (1/10)(√a + √b + √c + √d).

3.  Applying Jensen’s inequality and simplifying
----------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jensen,

  (1/10)(√a + √b + √c + √d)
    = α₁ f(x₁) + α₂ f(x₂) + α₃ f(x₃) + α₄ f(x₄)
    ≤ f( α₁ x₁ + α₂ x₂ + α₃ x₃ + α₄ x₄ )
    = √( α₁ a + α₂ b/4 + α₃ c/9 + α₄ d/16 ).

Multiply both sides by 10 to obtain the key inequality

  √a + √b + √c + √d
    ≤ 10 · √( (1/10)a + (2/10)(b/4) + (3/10)(c/9) + (4/10)(d/16) )
    = 10 · √( (a + b/2 + c/3 + d/4)/10 )
    = 10 · √( (12a + 6b + 4c + 3d) / 120 ).      (1)

4.  Bounding the linear combination 12a + 6b + 4c + 3d
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We now use the given constraints to show

  12a + 6b + 4c + 3d ≤ 120.

Observe the following exact decomposition:

  12a + 6b + 4c + 3d
    = 6a + 6a + 6b + 4c + 3d
    = (6a) + [2(a+b)] + [(a+b+c)] + [3(a+b+c+d)]

Grouping terms as indicated:
  • 6a ≤ 6·1 = 6   because a ≤ 1,
  • 2(a+b) ≤ 2·5 = 10  because a+b ≤ 5,
  •  (a+b+c) ≤ 14,
  •  3(a+b+c+d) ≤ 3·30 = 90.

Summing these four estimates gives

  12a + 6b + 4c + 3d ≤ 6 + 10 + 14 + 90 = 120.

5.  Final assembly and conclusion
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Substitute the bound 12a+6b+4c+3d ≤ 120 into inequality (1):

  √a + √b + √c + √d
    ≤ 10 · √( 120 / 120 )
    = 10 · 1
    = 10.

Hence for every admissible (a,b,c,d), the sum of square roots does not exceed 10.  Thus the smallest constant C with

  √a + √b + √c + √d ≤ C

for all constraints is C = 10.

6.  Attaining equality
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Equality in Jensen’s inequality (and in each of the linear bounds) occurs exactly when all intermediate inequalities are equalities.  One checks that

  a = 1,  b = 4,  c = 9,  d = 16

satisfy a ≤ 1, a+b = 5, a+b+c = 14, a+b+c+d = 30, and yield

  √a + √b + √c + √d = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

This shows the bound 10 is sharp.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 10$.
