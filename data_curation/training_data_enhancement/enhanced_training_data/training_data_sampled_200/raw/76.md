## Problem
Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. Find the smallest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$:
$$
C(a^3 + b^3) \geq (a + b)^3
$$

## Current Solution
The function $f(x)=x^{3}$ is convex on $(0,+\infty)$, thus from Jensen's inequality it follows that
$$
\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^{3} \leq \frac{a^{3}+b^{3}}{2} \Leftrightarrow 4\left(a^{3}+b^{3}\right) \geq(a+b)^{3}
$$

Equality holds when $a = b$, since then $a^3 + b^3 = 2a^3$ and $(a + b)^3 = (2a)^3 = 8a^3$, so $4(a^3 + b^3) = 8a^3 = (a + b)^3$. This gives the minimum value of $C$, so $C = 4$ is the smallest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 4$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 4$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

1. Definition of the function and verification of convexity
   Let φ: (0, +∞) → ℝ be defined by φ(x) = x³.  We compute its second derivative:
      φ′(x) = 3x²,
      φ″(x) = 6x.
   Since x > 0 on the domain (0, +∞), we have φ″(x) = 6x > 0 for all x > 0.  Therefore φ is strictly convex on (0, +∞).

2. Application of Jensen’s inequality
   For any convex function φ and any weights λ₁, λ₂ ≥ 0 with λ₁ + λ₂ = 1, Jensen’s inequality states
      φ(λ₁ a + λ₂ b) ≤ λ₁ φ(a) + λ₂ φ(b).
   Take λ₁ = λ₂ = 1/2.  Then λ₁ a + λ₂ b = (a + b)/2, and Jensen gives
      φ((a + b)/2) ≤ (1/2) φ(a) + (1/2) φ(b)
   or explicitly
      ((a + b)/2)³ ≤ (a³ + b³)/2.

3. Algebraic rearrangement to the desired form
   Multiply both sides of ((a + b)/2)³ ≤ (a³ + b³)/2 by 8 to clear the denominator:  
      8 · ((a + b)/2)³ ≤ 8 · ((a³ + b³)/2)
      ⇒ (a + b)³ ≤ 4 (a³ + b³).
   Thus for all a, b > 0 one has
      4 (a³ + b³) ≥ (a + b)³.
   In other words, the inequality C (a³ + b³) ≥ (a + b)³ holds with C = 4.

4. Sharpness and minimality of the constant
   To see that 4 is the smallest possible constant C, we check the equality case in Jensen’s inequality.  Equality holds if and only if a = b (since φ is strictly convex).  When a = b, say a = b = t > 0, both sides become:
      Left side:  4 (t³ + t³) = 8 t³,
      Right side: (t + t)³ = (2t)³ = 8 t³.
   Hence C cannot be taken smaller than 4 without violating the inequality for a = b.

5. Conclusion
   Combining existence (C = 4 works) and minimality (no smaller C works), we conclude that the smallest constant is C = 4.

The answer is $C=4$
