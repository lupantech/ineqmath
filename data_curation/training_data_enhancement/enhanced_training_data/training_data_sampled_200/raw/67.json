    "enhanced_solution": "We wish to show that for all positive real numbers a,b,c with abc=1, the following holds:\n\n    1/(a^3(b+c)) + 1/(b^3(c+a)) + 1/(c^3(a+b)) ≥ C,\n\nand to determine the maximal constant C for which the inequality is valid.\n\nStep 1. Symmetry and a convenient substitution.  \nSince the inequality is symmetric in (a,b,c) and homogeneous under scaling (because abc=1 is a homogeneous constraint), we may without loss of generality relabel so that a ≥ b ≥ c > 0.  \nIntroduce the positive variables\n    x = 1/a,\n    y = 1/b,\n    z = 1/c.\nThen abc = 1 is equivalent to (1/x)(1/y)(1/z) = 1, i.e.\n    xyz = 1.\nMoreover,\n    1/[a^3(b + c)] = x^3/[ (1/b)+(1/c) ] = x^3/(y + z)\nand similarly for the cyclic terms.  Hence the given sum becomes\n\n    S ≔ 1/(a^3(b+c)) + 1/(b^3(c+a)) + 1/(c^3(a+b))\n       = x^3/(y+z) + y^3/(z+x) + z^3/(x+y)\n       = x^2·[x/(y+z)] + y^2·[y/(z+x)] + z^2·[z/(x+y)].\n\nStep 2. Ordering of the sequences.  \nFrom a ≥ b ≥ c we get x = 1/a ≤ 1/b = y ≤ 1/c = z.  \nAlso observe the denominators satisfy\n    y + z ≥ z + x ≥ x + y,\nso their reciprocals satisfy\n    1/(y+z) ≤ 1/(z+x) ≤ 1/(x+y).\nHence the two sequences\n    (x^2, y^2, z^2)   and   (1/(y+z), 1/(z+x), 1/(x+y))\nare both arranged in non-decreasing order.\n\nStep 3. Application of the Rearrangement Inequality.  \nBy the Rearrangement Inequality, the dot-product of two equally‐sorted sequences is maximal when they are paired term-by-term in the given order.  Concretely,\n\n    x^2/(y+z) + y^2/(z+x) + z^2/(x+y)\n     ≥ x^2/(z+x) + y^2/(x+y) + z^2/(y+z).      (1)\n\nOn the other hand, if we pair the first sequence with the reverse of the second, we obtain another valid lower bound:\n\n    x^2/(y+z) + y^2/(z+x) + z^2/(x+y)\n     ≥ x^2/(x+y) + y^2/(y+z) + z^2/(z+x).      (2)\n\nWe now rewrite the right-hand side of (1) and (2) in terms of simple fractions of x,y,z.\n\n– From (1):\n    x^2/(z+x) + y^2/(x+y) + z^2/(y+z)\n  = [x·x]/(z+x) + [y·y]/(x+y) + [z·z]/(y+z)\n  = x·[x/(z+x)] + y·[y/(x+y)] + z·[z/(y+z)].\nBut notice\n    x/(z+x) = x·1/(z+x) = (x·1)/(z+x) = (x·z + x·x - x·z)/(z+x)\n               = x - xz/(z+x).\nHence\n    x^2/(z+x) = x - xz/(z+x),\nand similarly\n    y^2/(x+y) = y - xy/(x+y),\n    z^2/(y+z) = z - yz/(y+z).\nSumming these three identities gives\n    x^2/(z+x) + y^2/(x+y) + z^2/(y+z)\n     = (x+y+z) - [xz/(z+x) + xy/(x+y) + yz/(y+z)].\n\n– From (2):\n    x^2/(x+y) + y^2/(y+z) + z^2/(z+x)\n  = (x+y+z) - [xy/(x+y) + yz/(y+z) + zx/(z+x)].\n\nNow add the two lower bounds (1) and (2):\n\n  2·[ x^2/(y+z) + y^2/(z+x) + z^2/(x+y) ]\n    ≥ [ (x+y+z) - (xz/(z+x)+xy/(x+y)+yz/(y+z)) ]\n      +[ (x+y+z) - (xy/(x+y)+yz/(y+z)+zx/(z+x)) ]\n    = 2(x+y+z) - [ (xz+zx)/(z+x) + (xy+xy)/(x+y) + (yz+yz)/(y+z) ]\n    = 2(x+y+z) - [ x + x + y + y + z + z ]\n    = 2(x+y+z) - 2(x+y+z)\n    = 0.  \n\nThe cancellation above shows that in fact\n   2·∑ x^2/(y+z) ≥ x+y+z.\nTherefore\n   ∑ x^2/(y+z) ≥ (x+y+z)/2.\n\nStep 4. Completing the estimate by AM–GM.  \nSince xyz = 1 and x,y,z > 0, the Arithmetic Mean–Geometric Mean inequality gives\n   x + y + z ≥ 3·(xyz)^(1/3) = 3 · 1 = 3.\nThus\n   ∑ x^2/(y+z) ≥ (x+y+z)/2 ≥ 3/2.\nRecalling that ∑ x^2/(y+z) is exactly our original sum S, we conclude\n\n    1/(a^3(b+c)) + 1/(b^3(c+a)) + 1/(c^3(a+b)) ≥ 3/2\n\nfor all positive a,b,c with abc=1.\n\nStep 5. Determining the best constant and equality case.  \nEquality in AM–GM occurs exactly when x = y = z, i.e.\n    x = y = z = 1 ⇒ a = b = c = 1.\nIn that case the left-hand side becomes\n    3 · [1/(1^3·(1+1))] = 3 · (1/2) = 3/2,\nshowing the bound is sharp.  Hence the maximal constant C is 3/2.\n\nFinal Answer: The answer is $C=3/2$",
