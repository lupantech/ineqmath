## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a+b+c=3$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{a^{2}}{a+2 b^{3}}+\frac{b^{2}}{b+2 c^{3}}+\frac{c^{2}}{c+2 a^{3}} \geq C
$$

## Current Solution
Applying $A M \geq G M$ gives us
$$
\frac{a^{2}}{a+2 b^{3}}=a-\frac{2 a b^{3}}{a+2 b^{3}} \geq a-\frac{2 a b^{3}}{3 \sqrt[3]{a b^{4}}}=a-\frac{2 b a^{2 / 3}}{3}
$$

Analogously
$$
\frac{b^{2}}{b+2 c^{3}} \geq b-\frac{2 c b^{2 / 3}}{3} \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{c^{2}}{c+2 a^{3}} \geq c-\frac{2 a c^{2 / 3}}{3}
$$

Adding these three inequalities implies
$$
\frac{a^{2}}{a+2 b^{2}}+\frac{b^{2}}{b+2 c^{2}}+\frac{c^{2}}{c+2 a^{2}} \geq(a+b+c)-\frac{2}{3}\left(b a^{2 / 3}+c b^{2 / 3}+a c^{2 / 3}\right)
$$

So it is enough to prove that
$$
(a+b+c)-\frac{2}{3}\left(b a^{2 / 3}+c b^{2 / 3}+a c^{2 / 3}\right) \geq 1
$$
i.e.
$$
\begin{equation*}
b a^{2 / 3}+c b^{2 / 3}+a c^{2 / 3} \leq 3 \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

After another application of $A M \geq G M$ we get
$$
\begin{aligned}
b a^{2 / 3}+c b^{2 / 3}+a c^{2 / 3} & \leq \frac{b(2 a+1)+c(2 b+1)+a(2 c+1)}{3} \\
& =\frac{a+b+c+2(a b+b c+c a)}{3} \\
& \leq \frac{(a+b+c)+(a+b+c)^{2} / 3}{3}=\frac{3+2 \cdot 3^{2} / 3}{3}=3
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e. we have proved (1), and we are done.

Equality holds when $a = b = c = 1$, since then $a + b + c = 3$ and all terms are equal, so the minimum value of the sum is achieved and $C = 1$ is the largest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 1$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 1$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that for all positive real numbers a,b,c satisfying a+b+c=3, the following inequality holds and that the largest possible constant C is 1:  
  
      a^2/(a+2b^3) + b^2/(b+2c^3) + c^2/(c+2a^3)  ≥ C.  
  
Our strategy is to apply the AM–GM inequality twice: first to each denominator to obtain a lower bound on each term, and then to the resulting sum of mixed terms to obtain a numerical bound.  
  
1.  Rewrite each term in a suggestive form.  For the first term, set  
      T₁ = a^2/(a+2b^3) = a − (2 a b^3)/(a+2b^3).  
  
   Since a,b>0, we can apply AM–GM to the three positive numbers a, b^3, b^3:  
      a + b^3 + b^3  ≥ 3·(a·b^3·b^3)^(1/3) = 3·b^2·a^(1/3).  
   Hence  
      a+2b^3 ≥ 3 b^2 a^(1/3),  
   and thus  
      (2 a b^3)/(a+2b^3) ≤ (2 a b^3)/(3 b^2 a^(1/3)) = (2/3)·b·a^(2/3).  
   Consequently  
      T₁ ≥ a − (2/3)·b·a^(2/3).  
  
   By cyclically identical reasoning,  
      T₂ ≡ b^2/(b+2c^3) ≥ b − (2/3)·c·b^(2/3),  
      T₃ ≡ c^2/(c+2a^3) ≥ c − (2/3)·a·c^(2/3).  
  
2.  Sum the three estimates.  We obtain  
      a^2/(a+2b^3) + b^2/(b+2c^3) + c^2/(c+2a^3)  
      ≥ (a+b+c) − (2/3)·[b·a^(2/3) + c·b^(2/3) + a·c^(2/3)].  
  
   Since a+b+c=3, it suffices to prove  
      b·a^(2/3) + c·b^(2/3) + a·c^(2/3)  ≤ 3.   (*)  
  
3.  Bound the mixed sum by AM–GM a second time.  Observe that for any positive x,  
      x + x + 1 ≥ 3·(x^2·1)^(1/3) = 3 x^(2/3).  
   Replacing x by a and multiplying both sides by b/3 gives  
      b·a^(2/3) ≤ [b·(a + a + 1)]/3 = [b·(2a + 1)]/3.  
   Similarly,  
      c·b^(2/3) ≤ [c·(2b + 1)]/3,   a·c^(2/3) ≤ [a·(2c + 1)]/3.  
   Summing these three inequalities yields  
      b·a^(2/3) + c·b^(2/3) + a·c^(2/3)  
      ≤ [b(2a+1) + c(2b+1) + a(2c+1)]/3  
      = [2(ab+bc+ca) + (a+b+c)]/3.  
  
4.  Use the classical inequality ab+bc+ca ≤ (a+b+c)^2/3 valid for all nonnegative a,b,c.  Since a+b+c=3, we get ab+bc+ca ≤ 3.  Therefore  
      [2(ab+bc+ca) + (a+b+c)]/3 ≤ [2·3 + 3]/3 = 3.  
   This establishes (*) and hence the original inequality with C=1.  
  
5.  Finally, equality throughout AM–GM holds precisely when a=b=c=1.  Thus the largest constant for which the inequality is valid in all cases is C=1.  
  
The answer is $C=1$
