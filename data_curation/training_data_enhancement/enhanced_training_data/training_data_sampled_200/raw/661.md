## Problem
Let $x, y$ be positive real numbers and $m, n$ be positive integers. Consider the following inequality:
$$
(n-1)(m-1)\left(x^{m+n}+y^{m+n}\right)+(m+n-1)\left(x^{m} y^{n}+x^{n} y^{m}\right) \quad () \quad m n\left(x^{m+n-1} y+y^{m+n-1} x\right) .
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
We transform the inequality as follows:

$$
\begin{gathered}
m n(x-y)\left(x^{m+n-1}-y^{m+n-1}\right) \geq(m+n-1)\left(x^{m}-y^{m}\right)\left(x^{n}-y^{n}\right) \Leftrightarrow \\
\Leftrightarrow \frac{x^{m+n-1}-y^{m+n-1}}{(m+n-1)(x-y)} \geq \frac{x^{m}-y^{m}}{m(x-y)} \cdot \frac{x^{n}-y^{n}}{n(x-y)}
\end{gathered}
$$

(we have assumed that $x>y$ ). The last relation can also be written

$$
(x-y) \int_{y}^{x} t^{m+n-2} d t \geq \int_{y}^{x} t^{m-1} d t \cdot \int_{y}^{x} t^{n-1} d t
$$

and this follows from Chebyshev's Inequality for integrals. Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to determine the correct relational sign “()” in the inequality

  (n−1)(m−1)\bigl(x^{m+n}+y^{m+n}\bigr)
  + (m+n−1)\bigl(x^{m}y^{n}+x^{n}y^{m}\bigr)
  \;()\; m\,n\bigl(x^{m+n-1}y + y^{m+n-1}x\bigr),

where x, y are positive real numbers and m, n are positive integers.  The claimed answer is “≥”.  We now give a detailed, step-by-step justification of this fact, following exactly the original approach.

1.  Symmetry and the case x=y.

    Observe that the given inequality is symmetric in x and y: exchanging x and y leaves both sides unchanged.  In particular, if x=y then both sides coincide, so the inequality holds with equality.  Hence it suffices to prove the desired relation when x≠y; by symmetry we may assume without loss of generality that x>y.

2.  Rewriting the difference.

    We begin by bringing all terms to one side and factoring.  A direct expansion shows that the original inequality is equivalent to

      (n−1)(m−1)(x^{m+n}+y^{m+n}) + (m+n−1)(x^{m}y^{n}+x^{n}y^{m})
      
      \quad− mn(x^{m+n-1}y + y^{m+n-1}x)
      \;≥\;0.

    A further algebraic manipulation factors this expression as

      mn\,\bigl(x−y\bigr)\bigl(x^{m+n-1}−y^{m+n-1}\bigr)
      \;−\;(m+n−1)\bigl(x^{m}−y^{m}\bigr)\bigl(x^{n}−y^{n}\bigr)
      \;≥\;0.

    Thus the inequality is equivalent to

      mn\,(x−y)\,(x^{m+n-1}−y^{m+n-1})
      \;≥\;
      (m+n−1)\,(x^{m}−y^{m})\,(x^{n}−y^{n}).

3.  Division by positive factors.

    Since x>y>0 and m,n≥1, each of the factors mn, (m+n−1), and (x−y) is strictly positive.  We divide both sides of the last displayed inequality by the product mn\,(m+n−1)\,(x−y)>0.  This yields the equivalent form

      \frac{x^{m+n-1}−y^{m+n-1}}{(m+n−1)\,(x−y)}
      \;≥\;
      \frac{x^{m}−y^{m}}{m\,(x−y)}\;\times\;\frac{x^{n}−y^{n}}{n\,(x−y)}.

4.  Expressing differences via integrals.

    For any integer k≥1, the identity

      x^{k}−y^{k}  =  k\int_{y}^{x}t^{k-1}\,dt

    is immediate by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.  Hence

      \frac{x^{k}−y^{k}}{k\,(x−y)}  =  \frac{1}{x−y}\int_{y}^{x}t^{k-1}\,dt.

    Applying this with k=m, k=n, and k=m+n−1 gives the substitutions

      (i)  \frac{x^{m+n-1}−y^{m+n-1}}{(m+n-1)(x−y)}  =  \frac{1}{x−y}\int_{y}^{x}t^{m+n-2}\,dt,

      (ii) \frac{x^{m}−y^{m}}{m(x−y)}  =  \frac{1}{x−y}\int_{y}^{x}t^{m-1}\,dt,

      (iii)\frac{x^{n}−y^{n}}{n(x−y)}  =  \frac{1}{x−y}\int_{y}^{x}t^{n-1}\,dt.

    With the shorthand

      A  =  \int_{y}^{x}t^{m+n-2}\,dt,
      B  =  \int_{y}^{x}t^{m-1}\,dt,
      C  =  \int_{y}^{x}t^{n-1}\,dt,

    the inequality of Step 3 becomes

      \frac{A}{x−y}  \;≥\; \frac{B}{x−y}\;\times\;\frac{C}{x−y}
      \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
      (x−y)\,A  \;≥\; B\,C.

5.  Application of Chebyshev’s integral inequality.

    We now invoke Chebyshev’s Inequality in integral form: if f and g are integrable functions that are both monotonically increasing (or both monotonically decreasing) on [y,x], then

      \frac{1}{x−y}\int_{y}^{x}f(t)g(t)\,dt
      \;\ge\;
      \Bigl(\frac{1}{x−y}\int_{y}^{x}f(t)\,dt\Bigr)
      ·
      \Bigl(\frac{1}{x−y}\int_{y}^{x}g(t)\,dt\Bigr).

    In our setting we take

      f(t)=t^{m-1},
      g(t)=t^{n-1}.

    Both f and g are strictly increasing on [y,x], since m−1,n−1≥0.  Hence

      \frac{1}{x−y}\int_{y}^{x}t^{m-1}\,t^{n-1}\,dt
      \;\ge\;
      \Bigl(\frac{1}{x−y}\int_{y}^{x}t^{m-1}\,dt\Bigr)
      ·
      \Bigl(\frac{1}{x−y}\int_{y}^{x}t^{n-1}\,dt\Bigr).

    But \int_{y}^{x}t^{m-1}t^{n-1}dt=\int_{y}^{x}t^{m+n-2}dt=A, so this inequality reads exactly

      \frac{A}{x−y}  \;\ge\;  \frac{B}{x−y}\times\frac{C}{x−y},

    which is equivalent to (x−y)A ≥ B C, the form needed in Step 4.  Therefore the chain of equivalences is complete, and the original inequality holds in the direction “≥”.

Conclusion.  Combining the above steps shows that for all positive x,y and positive integers m,n,

  (n−1)(m−1)(x^{m+n}+y^{m+n}) + (m+n−1)(x^{m}y^{n}+x^{n}y^{m})
  \;\ge\; m n (x^{m+n-1}y + y^{m+n-1}x).

Hence the correct relation is “≥”, and the answer is

The answer is (B) ≥
