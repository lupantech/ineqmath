## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be the lengths of the sides of a triangle. Determine the minimal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$:
$$
(a+b-c)^{a}(b+c-a)^{b}(c+a-b)^{c} \leq C (a^{a} b^{b} c^{c}).
$$

## Current Solution
By the weighted power mean inequality we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sqrt[a+b+c]{\left(\frac{a+b-c}{a}\right)^{a}\left(\frac{b+c-a}{b}\right)^{b}\left(\frac{c+a-b}{c}\right)^{c}} \\
& \leq \frac{1}{a+b+c}\left(a \cdot \frac{a+b-c}{a}+b \cdot \frac{b+c-a}{b}+c \cdot \frac{c+a-b}{c}\right)=1
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e.
$$
(a+b-c)^{a}(b+c-a)^{b}(c+a-b)^{c} \leq a^{a} b^{b} c^{c}
$$

Equality occurs when $a = b = c$, that is, for an equilateral triangle. In this case, both sides of the inequality are equal, so $C = 1$ is the minimal constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 1$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 1$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to find the smallest constant C such that for any triangle with side lengths a, b, c > 0 satisfying the triangle inequalities a + b > c, b + c > a, c + a > b, the following holds:

  (1)    (a + b − c)^{a} · (b + c − a)^{b} · (c + a − b)^{c}   ≤   C · a^{a} · b^{b} · c^{c}.

We will show by a weighted AM–GM (arithmetic mean–geometric mean) argument that one can take C = 1, and that this value is minimal.

Step 1.  Positivity of each ratio.
Because a, b, c are side-lengths of a triangle, each of the three quantities (a + b − c), (b + c − a), (c + a − b) is strictly positive. Hence all expressions in (1) are well defined and positive.

Step 2.  Reformulate via weighted exponents.
Let S = a + b + c.  Define weights

    α = a⁄S,
    β = b⁄S,
    γ = c⁄S.

Then α + β + γ = 1 and each weight is positive.  Rewrite the left-hand side of (1) as

    (a + b − c)^{a}·(b + c − a)^{b}·(c + a − b)^{c}
    =
    igl[(a + b − c)⁄aigr]^{a}·a^{a}
    ·igl[(b + c − a)⁄bigr]^{b}·b^{b}
    ·igl[(c + a − b)⁄cigr]^{c}·c^{c}.

Dividing both sides of (1) by a^{a} b^{b} c^{c}, the inequality is equivalent to

    (2)    igl[(a + b − c)⁄aigr]^{a}  ·  igl[(b + c − a)⁄bigr]^{b}  ·  igl[(c + a − b)⁄cigr]^{c}
            ≤   C.

Step 3.  Apply weighted AM–GM to the three positive numbers X = (a + b − c)/a, Y = (b + c − a)/b, Z = (c + a − b)/c.
By the weighted arithmetic mean–geometric mean inequality, we have

    X^{α}·Y^{β}·Z^{γ}
    ≤ α·X + β·Y + γ·Z.

Observe that

    α·X + β·Y + γ·Z
    = (a/S)·((a + b − c)/a) + (b/S)·((b + c − a)/b) + (c/S)·((c + a − b)/c)
    = [(a + b − c) + (b + c − a) + (c + a − b)] / S
    = [2(a + b + c) − (a + b + c)] / S
    = (a + b + c)/S = 1.

Therefore

    X^{α}·Y^{β}·Z^{γ}  ≤  1,

which is the same as

    igl[(a + b − c)⁄aigr]^{a/S}
    ·igl[(b + c − a)⁄bigr]^{b/S}
    ·igl[(c + a − b)⁄cigr]^{c/S}
    ≤ 1.

Raising both sides to the power S = a + b + c > 0 yields exactly inequality (2) with C = 1.

Step 4.  Minimality of C = 1.
To see that no smaller constant can work, note that in the case a = b = c (an equilateral triangle) we have a + b − c = b + c − a = c + a − b = a.  Hence

    (a + b − c)^{a}·(b + c − a)^{b}·(c + a − b)^{c}
    = a^{a}·a^{b}·a^{c} = a^{a+b+c}
    = a^{a}·b^{b}·c^{c},

so both sides of (1) are equal and C cannot be taken below 1.

Conclusion.
Combining the above, the sharp (smallest) value of the constant is C = 1.

The answer is $C=1$
