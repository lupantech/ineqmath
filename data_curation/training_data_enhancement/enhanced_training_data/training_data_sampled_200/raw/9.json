We wish to determine the largest real constant C such that for all positive real numbers a,b,c the inequality\n\n    a^4 + b^4 + c^4  ≥  C · a b c (a + b + c)\n\nholds.\n\n2. Symmetric‐sum notation.  Define the following symmetric sums over variables a,b,c:\n\n   •  S_{4,0,0} :=  a^4 + b^4 + c^4,\n   •  S_{2,1,1} :=  a^2 b c + a b^2 c + a b c^2.\n\nThen the inequality to prove becomes\n\n   S_{4,0,0}  ≥  C · S_{2,1,1}.\n\n3. Determining the optimal constant.  \n   (a)  First, we show that C=1 works.  We must prove for all a,b,c>0:\n\n       a^4 + b^4 + c^4  ≥  1 · (a^2 b c + a b^2 c + a b c^2),\n\n       i.e.  S_{4,0,0}  ≥  S_{2,1,1}.\n\n   (b)  Application of Muirhead’s inequality.  Observe the exponent 3‐tuples:\n\n       (4,0,0)  and  (2,1,1).\n\n       Since (4,0,0) majorizes (2,1,1)—because 4 ≥ 2, and 4+0 ≥ 2+1—Muirhead’s theorem implies\n\n       S_{4,0,0}  ≥  S_{2,1,1}\n\n       for all positive a,b,c.  Hence the inequality holds with C=1.\n\n4. Sharpness of the constant.  To see that no larger C>1 can work, consider the special case a=b=c=t>0.  Then\n\n   LHS  =  t^4 + t^4 + t^4  =  3 t^4,\n   RHS  =  C · [t·t·t·(t+t+t)]  =  C · (t^3 · 3t)  =  3 C t^4.\n\n   The inequality 3 t^4 ≥ 3 C t^4 holds for all t>0 if and only if C ≤ 1.  Thus C=1 is the largest possible constant.\n\n5. Conclusion.  The optimal constant is\n\n   The answer is $C=1$",
