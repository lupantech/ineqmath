## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be real numbers. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}$:
$$
\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)^{2} \geq C\left(a^{3} b+b^{3} c+c^{3} a\right)
$$

## Current Solution
By the well-known inequality $(x+y+z)^{2} \geq 3(xy+yz+zx)$ for
$$
x = a^{2} + b c - a b, \quad y = b^{2} + c a - b c, \quad z = c^{2} + a b - c a
$$
we obtain the required inequality.

Equality holds when $a = b = c$, in which case both sides of the inequality are equal. This gives the maximum value of $C$ for which the inequality always holds, namely $C = 3$.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 3$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 3$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to prove that for all real numbers a,b,c there holds

  (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2  ≥  C · (a^3 b + b^3 c + c^3 a)

and to determine the maximal constant C for which this inequality is valid.  The given solution proceeds by a classical application of the identity

  (x + y + z)^2  ≥  3(xy + yz + zx),

which itself is equivalent to the obvious nonnegativity of
  (x−y)^2 + (y−z)^2 + (z−x)^2 ≥ 0.

We now follow exactly the same approach, but with full detail.

Step 1:  Introduce the auxiliary variables

  x = a^2 + bc − ab,
  y = b^2 + ca − bc,
  z = c^2 + ab − ca.

Step 2:  Compute the sum x + y + z.

  x + y + z
  = (a^2 + bc − ab)
  + (b^2 + ca − bc)
  + (c^2 + ab − ca)
  = a^2 + b^2 + c^2.

Thus
  (x + y + z)^2 = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2.

Step 3:  Compute the pairwise products xy, yz, zx and sum them.
We expand each product and then combine like terms:

  xy
  = (a^2 + bc − ab)(b^2 + ca − bc)
  = a^2 b^2   + a^3 c   − a^2 b c
  + b^3 c     + b c^2 a − b^2 c^2
  − a b^3     − a^2 b c + a b^2 c
  = a^2b^2 + a^3c + b^3c + bc^2a + ab^2c − b^2c^2 − ab^3 − 2a^2bc.

  Similarly,
  yz
  = (b^2 + ca − bc)(c^2 + ab − ca)
  = b^2c^2 + ab^3 − b^2ca + c^3a + a^2bc − c^2a^2 − bc^3 − ab^2c + bc^2a,

  zx
  = (c^2 + ab − ca)(a^2 + bc − ab)
  = a^2c^2 + a^3b − a^3c + bc^3 + ab^2c − bc^2a − abc^2 − a^2b^2 + a^2bc.

Adding these three expansions term by term, one finds that every mixed term cancels except for

  xy + yz + zx  =  a^3b + b^3c + c^3a.

Step 4:  Invoke the basic quadratic inequality.

  Since for all real x,y,z
    (x + y + z)^2  ≥  3(xy + yz + zx),
  we substitute our expressions for x + y + z and for xy + yz + zx:

    (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2  =  (x + y + z)^2
                         ≥  3·(xy + yz + zx)
                         = 3·(a^3b + b^3c + c^3a).

Thus we have proved

  (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2  ≥  3·(a^3b + b^3c + c^3a)

for all real a,b,c.

Step 5:  Optimality of C=3.

  Equality in (x + y + z)^2 ≥ 3(xy + yz + zx) occurs precisely when x = y = z.  In our notation that means
    a^2 + bc − ab  =  b^2 + ca − bc  =  c^2 + ab − ca.
  One checks at once that a = b = c satisfies these three equations.  Conversely, up to simultaneous sign–changes, the only way to force x=y=z is a=b=c.  Hence the constant C cannot be increased beyond 3 and still remain universally valid.

Therefore the largest such constant is 3.

The answer is $C=3$
