## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers. Find the largest positive number $C$ such that the inequality below holds for all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$:
$$
\frac{1}{a b(a+b)}+\frac{1}{b c(b+c)}+\frac{1}{c a(c+a)} \geq \frac{C}{a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}}
$$

## Current Solution
According to the obvious inequality $(a+b)(a-b)^{2} \geq 0$ we get the inequality
$$
a^{3}+b^{3} \geq a b(a+b)
$$

Thus
$$
\frac{1}{a b(a+b)} \geq \frac{1}{a^{3}+b^{3}}
$$

Similarly we get
$$
\frac{1}{b c(b+c)} \geq \frac{1}{b^{3}+c^{3}} \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{1}{c a(c+a)} \geq \frac{1}{c^{3}+a^{3}}
$$

After adding the last three inequalities we obtain
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{a b(a+b)}+\frac{1}{b c(b+c)}+\frac{1}{c a(c+a)} \geq \frac{1}{a^{3}+b^{3}}+\frac{1}{b^{3}+c^{3}}+\frac{1}{c^{3}+a^{3}} \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Now since $A M \geq H M$ we have
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{a^{3}+b^{3}}+\frac{1}{b^{3}+c^{3}}+\frac{1}{c^{3}+a^{3}} & \geq \frac{9}{\left(a^{3}+b^{3}\right)+\left(b^{3}+c^{3}\right)+\left(c^{3}+a^{3}\right)} \\
& =\frac{9}{2\left(a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}\right)} \tag{2}
\end{align*}
$$

From (1) and (2) we get the required inequality.

Equality holds if and only if $a = b = c$, in which case all inequalities above become equalities. This gives the minimum value of the left-hand side, so $C = \frac{9}{2}$ is the largest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \frac{9}{2}$.

## Expected Answer
$C = \frac{9}{2}$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to find the maximal constant C>0 such that for all positive real numbers a,b,c the following holds:

  (∗)    1/[a b (a+b)]  +  1/[b c (b+c)]  +  1/[c a (c+a)]  ≥  C / (a³ + b³ + c³).

We proceed in two main steps, each justified by a classical inequality.

Step 1.  Reduction to sums of the form 1/(a³+b³).

Claim 1. For any positive reals x,y we have

      x³ + y³  ≥  x y (x + y).

Proof of Claim 1.  Observe

      x³ + y³ − x y (x + y)
      = (x + y)(x² − x y + y²) − x y (x + y)
      = (x + y)[(x² − x y + y²) − x y]
      = (x + y)(x − y)²  ≥ 0,

since (x−y)²≥0 and x+y>0.  Hence x³+y³ ≥ x y (x+y).  Equivalently,

      1/[x y (x+y)]  ≥  1/(x³ + y³).

Applying this with (x,y) = (a,b), (b,c), and (c,a) gives three inequalities:

  (i)    1/[a b (a+b)]  ≥  1/(a³ + b³),
  (ii)   1/[b c (b+c)]  ≥  1/(b³ + c³),
  (iii)  1/[c a (c+a)]  ≥  1/(c³ + a³).

Summing (i)+(ii)+(iii) yields

  (1)    1/[a b (a+b)] + 1/[b c (b+c)] + 1/[c a (c+a)]
         ≥  1/(a³ + b³) + 1/(b³ + c³) + 1/(c³ + a³).

Step 2.  Applying the AM–HM inequality to the three positive numbers U₁ = a³ + b³, U₂ = b³ + c³, U₃ = c³ + a³.

The arithmetic–harmonic mean inequality (AM ≥ HM) states that for any positive U₁,U₂,U₃,

      (U₁ + U₂ + U₃)/3  ≥  3 / [1/U₁ + 1/U₂ + 1/U₃].

Rewriting gives

      1/U₁ + 1/U₂ + 1/U₃  ≥  9 / (U₁ + U₂ + U₃).

In our case,

      U₁ + U₂ + U₃  = (a³+b³) + (b³+c³) + (c³+a³)
                   = 2 (a³ + b³ + c³).

Hence

  (2)    1/(a³ + b³) + 1/(b³ + c³) + 1/(c³ + a³)
         ≥  9 / [2 (a³ + b³ + c³)].

Combining inequalities (1) and (2) by transitivity yields exactly (*) with C = 9/2:

      1/[a b (a+b)] + 1/[b c (b+c)] + 1/[c a (c+a)]
      ≥  9 / [2 (a³ + b³ + c³)].

Step 3.  Sharpness and extremal case.

We check that equality occurs when a=b=c.  
— In Claim 1 the step (x−y)²≥0 becomes equality iff x=y.  
— In AM–HM the equality holds iff U₁=U₂=U₃, i.e. a³+b³ = b³+c³ = c³+a³, which again forces a=b=c.  
Hence a=b=c is the unique (up to scaling) extremal case, and at that point the ratio of LHS to 1/(a³+b³+c³) is exactly 9/2.  Therefore no larger constant C can work for all positive a,b,c.

Conclusion. The largest constant C for which the original inequality holds for all a,b,c>0 is

      C = 9/2.

The answer is $C=9/2$.
