We use the weighted power mean inequality without changing the original approach.\n\nStep 1: Introduce positive weights that sum to 1\n\n  Let w₁ = 1/6,  w₂ = 2/6,  w₃ = 3/6.  Then each wᵢ > 0 and\n\n      w₁ + w₂ + w₃ = (1 + 2 + 3)/6 = 1.\n\nStep 2: Define the weighted arithmetic mean (first power mean) A and the weighted quadratic mean (second power mean) Q\n\n  A = w₁·a + w₂·b + w₃·c\n    = (1/6)·a + (2/6)·b + (3/6)·c\n    = (a + 2b + 3c)/6,\n\n  Q = \\sqrt{w₁·a² + w₂·b² + w₃·c²}\n    = \\sqrt{(1/6)·a² + (2/6)·b² + (3/6)·c²}\n    = \\sqrt{(a² + 2b² + 3c²)/6}.\n\nStep 3: Apply the weighted power mean inequality\n\n  For any positive numbers xᵢ and weights wᵢ > 0 with sum 1, the power mean with exponent r is\n\n      M_r = (w₁·x₁^r + w₂·x₂^r + w₃·x₃^r)^{1/r}.\n\n  The inequality states that if r < s, then M_r ≤ M_s.  Here take r = 1 and s = 2, so\n\n      A = M₁(a,b,c) ≤ M₂(a,b,c) = Q.\n\n  Hence\n\n      (a + 2b + 3c)/6  ≤  sqrt((a² + 2b² + 3c²)/6).\n\nStep 4: Transform into the desired form\n\n  Since both sides are nonnegative, we may square the inequality without changing its direction:\n\n      [(a + 2b + 3c)/6]²  ≤  ( (a² + 2b² + 3c²)/6 ).\n\n  Multiply both sides by 36 (which is positive), giving\n\n      (a + 2b + 3c)²  ≤  6·(a² + 2b² + 3c²).\n\n  Finally, divide both sides by (a² + 2b² + 3c²) (also positive) to isolate the original quotient:\n\n      (a + 2b + 3c)² / (a² + 2b² + 3c²)  ≤  6.\n\nThus the correct relation is “≤”.\n\nThe answer is (A) ≤",
