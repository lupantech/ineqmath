## Problem
Let $a, b, c, d > 0$ be real numbers. Let $u = ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd$ and $v = abc + abd + acd + bcd$. Consider the following inequality:
$$
2 u^{3} \quad () \quad 27 v^{2}
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
We have $p_{2}=\frac{u}{\binom{4}{2}}=\frac{u}{6}$ and $p_{3}=\frac{v}{\binom{4}{3}}=\frac{v}{4}$.
By Maclaurin's inequality we have
$$
p_{2}^{\frac{1}{2}} \geq p_{3}^{\frac{1}{3}} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad p_{2}^{3} \geq p_{3}^{2} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad\left(\frac{u}{6}\right)^{3} \geq\left(\frac{v}{4}\right)^{2} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 2 u^{3} \geq 27 v^{2}
$$

Equality occurs iff $a=b=c=d$. Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to compare the two symmetric expressions 2u³ and 27v², where u and v are defined by
  u = ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd,
  v = abc + abd + acd + bcd,
with a, b, c, d positive real numbers.  The original solution applies Maclaurin’s inequality to these elementary symmetric sums; we now give a more detailed and rigorous derivation of the same result.

1.  Definitions of elementary symmetric means:
   Let n = 4.  For k = 1,2,3,4, define the k-th elementary symmetric sum e_k by
     e_1 = a + b + c + d,
     e_2 = ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = u,
     e_3 = abc + abd + acd + bcd = v,
     e_4 = abcd.
   Then the k-th elementary symmetric mean is
     p_k = e_k / \binom{n}{k}.
   In particular,
     p_2 = e_2 / \binom{4}{2} = u/6,
     p_3 = e_3 / \binom{4}{3} = v/4.

2.  Statement of Maclaurin’s inequality:
   For any n positive real numbers, their elementary symmetric means satisfy
     p_1 ≥ √(p_2) ≥ ³√(p_3) ≥ ⁴√(p_4).
   More generally, for 1 ≤ r < s ≤ n,
     p_r^(1/r) ≥ p_s^(1/s).
   Whenever equality holds in one of these steps, all variables must be equal.

3.  Application to p_2 and p_3:
   Taking (r,s) = (2,3) gives
     p_2^(1/2) ≥ p_3^(1/3).
   Raising both sides to the 6th power (the least common multiple of 2 and 3) yields
     (p_2^(1/2))^6 ≥ (p_3^(1/3))^6
   ⇒ p_2^3 ≥ p_3^2.

4.  Substitution of u and v:
   Substitute p_2 = u/6 and p_3 = v/4 into p_2^3 ≥ p_3^2:
     (u/6)^3 ≥ (v/4)^2
   ⇒ u^3 / 6^3 ≥ v^2 / 4^2
   ⇒ u^3 / 216 ≥ v^2 / 16
   ⇒ multiplying both sides by 216·16 = 3456 gives
     16·u^3 ≥ 216·v^2
   ⇒ divide by 8
     2·u^3 ≥ 27·v^2.

5.  Conclusion and equality condition:
   Hence we have established the inequality
     2u^3 ≥ 27v^2
   for all positive a, b, c, d.  Moreover, equality holds precisely when a = b = c = d, since that is the condition for equality in Maclaurin’s inequality.

Therefore, the correct relation is “greater than or equal to.”  The answer is (B) ≥
