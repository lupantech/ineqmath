    "enhanced_solution": "We wish to find the largest constant C such that for any nonnegative real numbers x₁,…,xₙ with x₁+⋯+xₙ ≤ 1/2, the product\n\n    (1−x₁)(1−x₂)⋯(1−xₙ)\n\nis bounded below by C.  We will show by a careful application of a product‐version of Bernoulli’s inequality that\n\n    (1−x₁)(1−x₂)⋯(1−xₙ) ≥ 1 − (x₁+⋯+xₙ) ≥ 1 − 1/2 = 1/2,\n\nand that this bound is sharp (so C = 1/2).\n\nStep 1.  Bound each xᵢ.\nSince x₁,…,xₙ are nonnegative and their sum is at most 1/2, each xᵢ satisfies\n\n    0 ≤ xᵢ ≤ x₁+⋯+xₙ ≤ 1/2 < 1.\n\nHence 1−xᵢ > 0 for every i.\n\nStep 2.  Set a convenient notation.\nDefine aᵢ = −xᵢ for i = 1,…,n.  Then each aᵢ lies in the interval [−1,0], and all the aᵢ’s are nonpositive (i.e. of the same sign).  Moreover,\n\n    ∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ = −∑_{i=1}ⁿ xᵢ ≥ −1/2.\n\nIn these terms,\n\n    1 − xᵢ = 1 + aᵢ,   so   (1−x₁)…(1−xₙ) = ∏_{i=1}ⁿ (1 + aᵢ).\n\nStep 3.  Apply the product‐version of Bernoulli’s inequality.\nWe claim that whenever a₁,…,aₙ ≥ −1 and all have the same sign, one has\n\n    ∏_{i=1}ⁿ(1 + aᵢ) ≥ 1 + ∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ.\n\nProof (by induction):\n• Base case n=1 is trivial: ∏(1 + a₁)=1 + a₁.\n• Inductive step: assume for n factors\n      ∏_{i=1}ⁿ(1 + aᵢ) ≥ 1 + ∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ.\n  Then multiplying by (1 + aₙ₊₁) gives\n\n    ∏_{i=1}^{n+1}(1 + aᵢ) = (∏_{i=1}ⁿ(1 + aᵢ))·(1 + aₙ₊₁)\n      ≥ (1 + ∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ)(1 + aₙ₊₁)\n      = 1 + ∑_{i=1}^{n+1} aᵢ + \bigl(∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ\bigr)aₙ₊₁.\n\n  Since each aᵢ ≤ 0, both ∑_{i=1}ⁿ aᵢ ≤ 0 and aₙ₊₁ ≤ 0, so their product is ≥0.  Hence\n\n    ∏_{i=1}^{n+1}(1 + aᵢ) ≥ 1 + ∑_{i=1}^{n+1} aᵢ,\n\n  completing the induction.\n\nStep 4.  Conclude the lower bound.\nApplying this to aᵢ = −xᵢ gives\n\n    (1−x₁)…(1−xₙ) = ∏(1 + aᵢ) ≥ 1 + ∑aᵢ = 1 − (x₁+…+xₙ) ≥ 1 − 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThus the product is always at least 1/2.\n\nStep 5.  Show sharpness.\nEquality in the product‐Bernoulli step holds exactly when at most one of the aᵢ is nonzero, i.e. at most one xᵢ>0.  To make 1 − (x₁+⋯+xₙ) minimal under the constraint ∑xᵢ ≤ 1/2, we take one variable equal to 1/2 and the rest zero.  Then the product is exactly 1−1/2 = 1/2.\n\nHence the largest possible constant C for which\n\n    (1−x₁)…(1−xₙ) ≥ C\n\nalways holds is C = 1/2.\n\nThe answer is $C=\\tfrac12$",
