& =\frac{a+b+c}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$ Therefore, the answer is (A) $\leq$.

## Expected Answer

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to compare the two quantities

  a^b b^c c^a     and     ((a + b + c)/3)^{a + b + c}

and decide which inequality holds for all positive real a, b, c.  The original solution uses a weighted AM–GM argument together with a well-known bound on ab + bc + ca.  We now expand each step in full detail.

**Step 1. Rewrite the left side as a weighted geometric mean.**

Observe that

  (a^b b^c c^a)^{1/(a + b + c)}
  = a^{b/(a + b + c)} \cdot b^{c/(a + b + c)} \cdot c^{a/(a + b + c)}.

Here the exponents

  w_1 = b/(a + b + c),
  w_2 = c/(a + b + c),
  w_3 = a/(a + b + c)

are nonnegative and satisfy

  w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = (a + b + c)/(a + b + c) = 1.

Thus a^b b^c c^a to the power 1/(a + b + c) is exactly the geometric mean of the numbers a, b, c with weights w_1, w_2, w_3.

**Step 2. Apply the weighted AM–GM inequality.**

The weighted arithmetic–geometric mean (AM–GM) inequality states that for any nonnegative numbers x_1, x_2, x_3 and weights w_1, w_2, w_3 with w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 1, one has

  x_1^{w_1} \, x_2^{w_2} \, x_3^{w_3}
    ≤ w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3.

We apply this with x_1 = a, x_2 = b, x_3 = c and the weights defined above.  Therefore

  a^{b/(a + b + c)} \cdot b^{c/(a + b + c)} \cdot c^{a/(a + b + c)}
    ≤ (b/(a + b + c))·a + (c/(a + b + c))·b + (a/(a + b + c))·c
  = (ba + cb + ac)/(a + b + c).

Hence

  (a^b b^c c^a)^{1/(a + b + c)} ≤ (ba + bc + ca)/(a + b + c).

**Step 3. Bound the sum of pairwise products by (a + b + c)²/3.**

We claim that for any positive a, b, c,

  ab + bc + ca ≤ (a + b + c)²/3.

Equivalently,

  3(ab + bc + ca) ≤ (a + b + c)²
  = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

Rearrange:

  3(ab + bc + ca) − 2(ab + bc + ca) ≤ a² + b² + c²
  ⇒ ab + bc + ca ≤ a² + b² + c².

But a² + b² + c² ≥ ab + bc + ca is itself a standard consequence of

  a² + b² − 2ab = (a − b)² ≥ 0,
  b² + c² − 2bc = (b − c)² ≥ 0,
  c² + a² − 2ca = (c − a)² ≥ 0,

and summing any two of these shows a² + b² + c² ≥ ab + bc + ca.  Thus the desired bound holds.

Therefore,

  (ba + bc + ca)/(a + b + c) ≤ [ (a + b + c)²/3 ] / (a + b + c)
  = (a + b + c)/3.

**Step 4. Combine the inequalities.**

Putting Steps 2 and 3 together,

  (a^b b^c c^a)^{1/(a + b + c)} ≤ (ba + bc + ca)/(a + b + c) ≤ (a + b + c)/3.

Since the function x ↦ x^{a + b + c} is strictly increasing for x > 0, we may raise both sides of the outer inequality to the power a + b + c and preserve the direction.  Hence

  a^b b^c c^a ≤ ((a + b + c)/3)^{a + b + c}.

This shows that for all positive a, b, c,

  a^b b^c c^a ≤ ((a + b + c)/3)^{a + b + c}.

**Conclusion.**  The correct relation is “≤.”

The answer is (A) ≤
