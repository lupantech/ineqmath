## Problem
Let $x, y, z > 0$ be real numbers. Determine the maximal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x, y, z$:
$$
(x y + y z + z x) \left( \frac{1}{(x + y)^2} + \frac{1}{(y + z)^2} + \frac{1}{(z + x)^2} \right) \geq C.
$$

## Current Solution
The given inequality is equivalent to
$$
\begin{align*}
& 4(x y+y z+z x)\left((z+x)^{2}(y+z)^{2}+(x+y)^{2}(z+x)^{2}+(x+y)^{2}(y+z)^{2}\right) \\
& \quad \geq 9(x+y)^{2}(y+z)^{2}(z+x)^{2} \tag{1}
\end{align*}
$$

Let us denote $p=x+y+z, q=x y+y z+z x, r=x y z$.
By $I_{5}$ and $I_{7}$ we have
$$
(x+y)^{2}(y+z)^{2}(z+x)^{2}=(p q-r)^{2}
$$
and
$$
(x+y)^{2}(y+z)^{2}+(y+z)^{2}(z+x)^{2}+(z+x)^{2}(x+y)^{2}=\left(p^{2}+q\right)^{2}-4 p(p q-r)
$$

So we can rewrite inequality (1) as follows
$$
\begin{aligned}
& 4 q\left(\left(p^{2}+q\right)^{2}-4 p(p q-r)\right) \geq 9(p q-r)^{2} \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 4 p^{4} q-17 p^{2} q^{2}+4 q^{3}+34 p q r-9 r^{2} \geq 0 \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 3 p q\left(p^{3}-4 p q+9 r\right)+q\left(p^{4}-5 p^{2} q+4 q^{2}+6 p r\right)+r(p q-9 r) \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

The last inequality follows from $N_{1}, N_{2}$ and $N_{3}$, and the fact that $p, q, r>0$. Equality occurs if and only if $x=y=z$.

Equality holds when $x = y = z$, in which case $(xy + yz + zx) = 3x^2$ and $\frac{1}{(x+y)^2} + \frac{1}{(y+z)^2} + \frac{1}{(z+x)^2} = \frac{3}{(2x)^2} = \frac{3}{4x^2}$, so the left side is $3x^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4x^2} = \frac{9}{4}$. Thus, the minimum value of the expression is $C = \frac{9}{4}$.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \frac{9}{4}$.

## Expected Answer
$C = \frac{9}{4}$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to prove that for all positive real x,y,z,

  (xy+yz+zx) \Bigl(\frac1{(x+y)^2}+\frac1{(y+z)^2}+\frac1{(z+x)^2}\Bigr) \ge C,

and to find the maximal such constant C.  We will show C=9/4 by following the same approach as the original solution, but with complete details at each step.

1.  Rewrite the desired inequality with C=9/4.  We must show

  (xy+yz+zx) \Bigl(\sum_{\mathrm{cyc}}\frac1{(x+y)^2}\Bigr) \ge \tfrac94.

2.  Clear denominators.  Since x+y,y+z,z+x>0, multiply both sides by
  4\,(x+y)^2(y+z)^2(z+x)^2 to obtain the equivalent form

  4\,(xy+yz+zx)\,\sum_{\mathrm{cyc}}\bigl((z+x)^2(y+z)^2\bigr)
    \;\ge\; 9\,(x+y)^2(y+z)^2(z+x)^2.

  Denote p=x+y+z, q=xy+yz+zx, and r=xyz.  We will express each symmetric sum in terms of p,q,r.

3.  Identity for the triple product:  
  (x+y)(y+z)(z+x) = p\,q - r.
  Hence

    (x+y)^2(y+z)^2(z+x)^2 = (p q - r)^2.    (Identity I)

4.  Identity for the sum of squares of two-fold products:  
  Expand or invoke a standard symmetric-sum formula to obtain

    (x+y)^2(y+z)^2 + (y+z)^2(z+x)^2 + (z+x)^2(x+y)^2
    = (p^2+q)^2 
      \;-
      4p\,(p q - r).

  (A direct expansion or a known result for sums of symmetric squares.)   (Identity II)

5.  Substitute (I) and (II) into the cleared-denominator inequality.  The left side becomes

    4q\bigl((p^2+q)^2 - 4p(pq-r)\bigr),

  and the right side is 9(pq - r)^2.  Thus the inequality is

    4q\bigl((p^2+q)^2 - 4p(pq-r)\bigr)
      \;\ge\; 9(pq - r)^2.

  Expand both sides and bring everything to the left:

    4p^4q - 17p^2q^2 + 4q^3 + 34pqr - 9r^2 \;\ge\; 0.

6.  Group and factor this quartic form into three nonnegative terms:

    4p^4q - 17p^2q^2 + 4q^3 + 34pqr - 9r^2
    = 3pq\bigl(p^3 - 4pq + 9r\bigr)
    \;+
      q\bigl(p^4 - 5p^2q + 4q^2 + 6pr\bigr)
    \;+
      r\,(pq - 9r).

7.  Verify each grouped factor is nonnegative for x,y,z>0:
  a)  By Schur’s inequality of degree 3,  p^3 + 9r \ge 4pq,  so
       p^3 - 4pq + 9r \ge 0.  Hence  3pq(p^3 - 4pq + 9r) \ge 0.
  b)  By Schur’s inequality of degree 4 (or by a direct symmetric-sum argument),
       p^4 - 5p^2q + 4q^2 + 6pr \ge 0,  so  q(p^4 - 5p^2q + 4q^2 + 6pr) \ge 0.
  c)  By AM–GM on x,y,z,
       pq = (x+y+z)(xy+yz+zx) \ge 9xyz = 9r,  so  r(pq - 9r) \ge 0.

  Since p,q,r>0, each of the three terms is nonnegative, and hence their sum is nonnegative.  This completes the proof of the inequality for C=9/4.

8.  Equality analysis.  Equality in all three groupings occurs precisely when x=y=z.  Substituting x=y=z into the original expression gives

    (xy+yz+zx) = 3x^2,
    \sum_{\mathrm{cyc}}\frac1{(x+y)^2} = 3\,/\,(2x)^2 = \tfrac3{4x^2},

  so the left-hand side equals 3x^2·(3/(4x^2)) = 9/4.  Thus the constant 9/4 is attained and is maximal.

Therefore, the maximal constant C is 9/4.

The answer is $C = \frac{9}{4}$.
