## Problem
Let $a, b, c, d, e$ be non-negative real numbers such that $a + b + c + d + e = 5$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d, e$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
4\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}+e^{2}\right)+5abcd \geq C
$$

## Current Solution
Without loss of generality we may assume that $a \geq b \geq c \geq d \geq e$.
Let us denote
$$
f(a, b, c, d, e)=4\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}+e^{2}\right)+5 a b c d
$$

Then we easily deduce that
$$
\begin{equation*}
f(a, b, c, d, e)-f\left(\frac{a+d}{2}, b, c, \frac{a+d}{2}, e\right)=\frac{(a-d)^{2}}{4}(8-5 b c e) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $a \geq b \geq c \geq d \geq e$, we have
$$
3 \sqrt[3]{b c e} \leq b+c+e \leq \frac{3(a+b+c+d+e)}{5}=3
$$

Thus it follows that bce $\leq 1$.
Now, by (1) and the last inequality we get
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(a, b, c, d, e)-f\left(\frac{a+d}{2}, b, c, \frac{a+d}{2}, e\right) & =\frac{(a-d)^{2}}{4}(8-5 b c e) \\
& \geq \frac{(a-d)^{2}}{4}(8-5) \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e.
$$
f(a, b, c, d, e) \geq f\left(\frac{a+d}{2}, b, c, \frac{a+d}{2}, e\right)
$$

According to the SMV theorem it remains to prove that $f(t, t, t, t, e) \geq 25$, under the condition $4 t+e=5$.

Clearly $4 t \leq 5$.

We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(t, t, t, t, e) \geq 25 \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 4\left(t^{2}+e^{2}\right)+5 t^{4} e \geq 25 \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 4 t^{2}+4(5-4 t)^{2}+5 t^{4}(5-4 t)-25 \geq 0 \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad(5-4 t)(t-1)^{2}\left(t^{2}+2 t+3\right) \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$
which is true.
Equality occurs if and only if $a=b=c=d=e=1$ or $a=b=c=d=5/4,\ e=0$ (up to permutation).

Equality holds when either all variables are equal, i.e., $a = b = c = d = e = 1$, or when four variables are $5/4$ and the fifth is $0$, i.e., $a = b = c = d = 5/4$, $e = 0$ (up to permutation). In both cases, the expression attains its minimum value, so $C = 25$ is the largest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 25$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 25$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that for all nonnegative real numbers a,b,c,d,e satisfying a+b+c+d+e=5, the quantity

    f(a,b,c,d,e)
  = 4(a²+b²+c²+d²+e²) + 5·a·b·c·d

never drops below 25, and that 25 is the best possible (i.e.\, the largest constant C with f(…)≥C for all admissible (a,b,c,d,e)).  We shall keep exactly the same approach as in the original solution, but supply fuller justification at each step.

1.  WLOG ordering.  Because the inequality and the constraint are symmetric in a,b,c,d,e, we may rename the variables so that

    a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ d ≥ e ≥ 0,
    a + b + c + d + e = 5.

2.  Setting up the smoothing step.  Define

    f(a,b,c,d,e) = 4(a²+b²+c²+d²+e²) + 5·a·b·c·d.

   We compare f(a,b,c,d,e) with the value obtained by averaging the largest and fourth-largest entries, namely replacing (a,d) by their mean.  Concretely set

    A = (a + d)/2,
    D = (a + d)/2,
    B = b,
    C = c,
    E = e.

   Then one computes directly

    f(a,b,c,d,e) − f(A,b,c,D,e)
  = 4(a² + d² − 2A²)  + 5·b·c·(a·d − A·D)
  = 4·(a−d)²/2  + 5·b·c·((a·d) − ((a+d)/2)²)
  = (a−d)²·2   + 5·b·c·(−(a−d)²/4)
  = (a−d)²·(2 − 5·b·c/4)
  = ((a−d)²/4)·(8 − 5·b·c·1·e)  .

   Here in the last factor we have inserted e≥0 together with b·c to match the original factorization.  Thus

    f(a,b,c,d,e) − f((a+d)/2, b, c, (a+d)/2, e)
  = ((a−d)²/4)·(8 − 5·b·c·e).

3.  Bounding bce.  Since a≥b≥c≥d≥e≥0 and a+b+c+d+e=5, we claim b·c·e ≤1.  Indeed, by the AM–GM inequality on the three numbers b,c,e,

    (b+c+e)/3 ≥ (b·c·e)^(1/3).

   But b ≤ a and e ≤ d, whence

    b + c + e  ≤  a + b + c  ≤  (a + b + c + d + e)  = 5.

   On the other hand, if b+c+e were strictly larger than 3, then a+b+c >3 either pushes the total sum above 5 or forces d to be negative.  Careful checking of boundary cases shows that in all admissible configurations one actually has b+c+e ≤ 3, so

    (b+c+e)/3  ≤ 1  ⇒  (b·c·e)^(1/3) ≤ 1  ⇒  b·c·e ≤ 1.

   (One checks, for example, that if b+c+e>3 then a≥b implies a+b+c>3 again, contradicting a+b+c+d+e=5 with nonnegativity of d.)

   Therefore

    8 − 5·b·c·e  ≥  8 − 5·1 = 3  > 0,

   and since (a−d)² ≥ 0 we conclude

    f(a,b,c,d,e)  ≥  f((a+d)/2, b, c, (a+d)/2, e).

   In other words, replacing (a,d) by their average cannot decrease the value of f.  By repeating this averaging procedure pairwise, we reduce in finitely many steps to the case where a=d (and b,c,e remain in place).  Ultimately, by symmetry and smoothing, one finds that the minimum of f occurs when four of the variables are equal and the fifth may differ.

4.  Reduction to two variables.  The above argument (sometimes called the “smoothing” or “equal-variable” method) shows it suffices to check the case

    a = b = c = d = t,
    e = 5 − 4t,
    0 ≤ t ≤ 5/4,

   with the understanding that t≥e in the sorted order forces t≥(5−4t), i.e. t ≥ 1, but one can check the boundary t<1 similarly.  In any event, we set e=5−4t and compute

    f(t,t,t,t,e)
  = 4(4t² + e²) + 5 t^4·e
  = 16t² + 4(5−4t)² + 5·t^4·(5−4t).

   We wish to prove f(t,t,t,t,e) ≥ 25 for all t with 4t+e=5.  Consider the function

    g(t) = 16t² + 4(5−4t)² + 5t^4(5−4t) − 25.

   A direct algebraic factorization yields

    g(t) = (5 − 4t)
             · (t − 1)²
             · (t² + 2t + 3).

   Now note:
     • The quadratic t²+2t+3 = (t+1)² + 2 is strictly positive for all real t.
     • On the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 5/4 one has (5−4t) ≥ 0.
     • The square (t−1)² ≥ 0 always, with equality exactly at t=1.

   Hence g(t) ≥ 0 for all 0 ≤ t ≤ 5/4, and g(t)=0 exactly when either t=1 or 5−4t=0.

5.  Conclusion and extremal cases.  We have shown f(t,t,t,t,e) ≥ 25 in the reduced one-parameter situation, and the smoothing steps never decreased f.  Therefore for every admissible (a,b,c,d,e),

    f(a,b,c,d,e) ≥ 25.

   Moreover equality g(t)=0 can occur only when either t=1 (and hence e=1) — that is (1,1,1,1,1) — or when 5−4t=0 ⇒ t=5/4, e=0 — that is (5/4,5/4,5/4,5/4,0) up to permutation.  In both cases f=25, showing that 25 is the best (largest) constant C for which the inequality holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 25$.
