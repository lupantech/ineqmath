We will show by a two‐step application of the Cauchy–Schwarz (Titu’s) lemma that C=1 is the maximal such constant.\n\nStep 1:  Reduce to a simpler comparison.\n----------------------------------------\nApply Cauchy–Schwarz in the form\n  (x1^2/u1 + x2^2/u2 + x3^2/u3)·(u1 + u2 + u3)  ≥  (x1 + x2 + x3)^2,\nwith the identifications\n  x1 = a^(3/2)/b ,  u1 = b ,\n  x2 = b^(3/2)/c ,  u2 = c ,\n  x3 = c^(3/2)/a ,  u3 = a.\nThen\n  x1^2/u1 + x2^2/u2 + x3^2/u3   =   a^3/b^2 + b^3/c^2 + c^3/a^2,\nand\n  u1 + u2 + u3   =   a + b + c,\nwhile\n  x1 + x2 + x3   =   a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a.\nHence Cauchy–Schwarz yields\n  (a^3/b^2 + b^3/c^2 + c^3/a^2)·(a + b + c)  ≥  (a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a)^2.\nDividing both sides by (a + b + c)>0 gives the equivalent inequality\n  (2)    a^3/b^2 + b^3/c^2 + c^3/a^2   ≥   (a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a)^2  ÷  (a + b + c).\n\nConsequently, to prove (1) it suffices to show\n  (a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a)^2  ÷  (a + b + c)   ≥   C · (a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a).\nSince the factor (a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a) is positive, this is equivalent to\n  (3)    a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a   ≥   C · (a + b + c).\n\nStep 2:  Establish the linear bound.\n-------------------------------------\nWe now apply Cauchy–Schwarz (Titu’s lemma) once more in the form\n  ∑(a^2/b)  ≥  (∑a)^2  ÷  (∑b).\nHere ∑a = a + b + c and ∑b = a + b + c, so\n  a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a   ≥   (a + b + c)^2 / (a + b + c)   =   a + b + c.\nComparing with (3), we see that the inequality holds with C=1.  Moreover, if we attempted any larger C>1, then for a=b=c the left‐side equals the right‐side exactly, preventing any strict improvement of C.\n\nEquality Case and Maximality:\nWhen a=b=c, all intermediate Cauchy–Schwarz applications become equalities, and both sides of the original inequality coincide.  Hence C=1 is attained and cannot be increased without violating the inequality in the equal‐variable case.\n\nConclusion:\nBy the above rigorous derivation, the largest constant C for which (1) holds for all positive a,b,c is C=1.\n\nThe answer is $C=1$",
