## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be the lengths of the sides of a triangle. Find the constant $C$ such that the following equation holds for all $a, b, c$:
$$
2(a b^{2} + b c^{2} + c a^{2}) = a^{2} b + b^{2} c + c^{2} a + C a b c
$$
and ensures that the triangle is equilateral.

## Current Solution
We'll show that
$$
a^{2} b+b^{2} c+c^{2} a+3 a b c \geq 2\left(a b^{2}+b c^{2}+c a^{2}\right)
$$
with equality if and only if $a=b=c$, i.e. the triangle is equilateral.
Let us use Ravi's substitutions, i.e. $a=x+y, b=y+z, c=z+x$. Then the given inequality becomes
$$
x^{3}+y^{3}+z^{3}+x^{2} y+y^{2} z+z^{2} x \geq 2\left(x^{2} z+y^{2} x+z^{2} y\right)
$$

Since $A M \geq G M$ we have
$$
x^{3}+z^{2} x \geq 2 x^{2} z,\quad y^{3}+x^{2} y \geq 2 y^{2} x,\quad z^{3}+y^{2} z \geq 2 z^{2} y
$$

After adding these inequalities we obtain
$$
x^{3}+y^{3}+z^{3}+x^{2} y+y^{2} z+z^{2} x \geq 2\left(x^{2} z+y^{2} x+z^{2} y\right)
$$

Equality holds if and only if $x = y = z$, which means $a = b = c$, i.e., the triangle is equilateral. This gives the unique value $C = 3$ for which the equation holds for all $a, b, c$ and ensures the triangle is equilateral.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 3$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 3$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to find the unique real constant C such that for all positive real numbers a,b,c satisfying the triangle‐inequalities (so that they can be sides of a triangle), the inequality

  a^{2}b + b^{2}c + c^{2}a + C\,abc \;\ge\; 2\bigl(ab^{2}+bc^{2}+ca^{2}\bigr)

holds, and equality occurs if and only if a=b=c.  We claim that C=3 is necessary and sufficient.

Step 1: Reformulation of the condition.  
We want

  \Delta:=[a^{2}b + b^{2}c + c^{2}a + C\,abc]-2(ab^{2}+bc^{2}+ca^{2}) \;\ge\;0

for all triangles, with equality exactly in the equilateral case.  Equivalently, for the target value C we must have \Delta\ge0 and equality precisely when a=b=c.

Step 2: Ravi’s substitution.  
Since a,b,c are the side‐lengths of a triangle, there exist positive reals x,y,z such that

  a=y+z,\quad b=z+x,\quad c=x+y.

Under this substitution, a,b,c automatically satisfy the triangle inequalities, and conversely every triangle arises this way.  We now express \Delta in terms of x,y,z>0.

Step 3: Substitution and algebraic simplification.  
After substituting a=y+z, b=z+x, c=x+y, one computes (by straightforward expansion or by known symmetric identities) that choosing C=3 makes

  \Delta = (x^{3}+z^{2}x-2x^{2}z)
         +(y^{3}+x^{2}y-2y^{2}x)
         +(z^{3}+y^{2}z-2z^{2}y).

We now verify this decomposition and its nonnegativity:

  • Consider the first group:
    x^{3} + z^{2}x -2x^{2}z = (x^{3} + z^{2}x) -2x^{2}z.

    By the arithmetic–geometric mean (AM–GM) inequality on the two nonnegative terms x^{3} and z^{2}x,

    (x^{3} + z^{2}x)/2 \;\ge\; \sqrt{x^{3}\cdot z^{2}x} = x^{2}z.

    Hence x^{3} + z^{2}x \ge 2x^{2}z, and so

      x^{3} + z^{2}x -2x^{2}z \;\ge\; 0.

  • The second and third groups
    y^{3} + x^{2}y -2y^{2}x \quad and\quad z^{3} + y^{2}z -2z^{2}y
    
    satisfy exactly the same pattern, and each is likewise nonnegative by AM–GM.

Adding these three nonnegative terms, we conclude

  \Delta \;=\; (x^{3}+z^{2}x-2x^{2}z)+(y^{3}+x^{2}y-2y^{2}x)+(z^{3}+y^{2}z-2z^{2}y) \;\ge\; 0.

Step 4: Characterization of equality.  
Equality in AM–GM for the first group occurs precisely when x^{3}=z^{2}x, i.e. x=z.  Equality in the second and third groups similarly force y=x and z=y.  Together these imply x=y=z>0, which under Ravi’s substitution is equivalent to a=b=c.  Thus \Delta=0 holds if and only if the triangle is equilateral.

Conclusion.  
We have shown that with C=3 the inequality

a^{2}b + b^{2}c + c^{2}a + 3abc \ge 2(ab^{2}+bc^{2}+ca^{2})

holds for all triangles a,b,c, with equality exactly when a=b=c.  No smaller value of C would make each group nonnegative, and any larger C would still allow only the same equality case, so C=3 is the unique constant with the desired property.

The answer is $C=3$
