## Problem
Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ such that $x + y = 2$. Determine the minimal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x, y$:
$$
x^{3} y^{3}\left(x^{3}+y^{3}\right) \leq C.
$$

## Current Solution
Since $A M \geq G M$ we have $\sqrt{x y} \leq \frac{x+y}{2}=1$, i.e. $x y \leq 1$.
Hence $0 \leq x y \leq 1$.
Furthermore
$$
\begin{aligned}
x^{3} y^{3}\left(x^{3}+y^{3}\right) & =(x y)^{3}(x+y)\left(x^{2}-x y+y^{2}\right)=2(x y)^{3}\left((x+y)^{2}-3 x y\right) \\
& =2(x y)^{3}(4-3 x y)
\end{aligned}
$$

It's enough to show that
$$
(x y)^{3}(4-3 x y) \leq 1
$$

Let $x y=z$ then $0 \leq z \leq 1$ and clearly $4-3 z>0$.

Then using $A M \geq G M$ we obtain
$$
z^{3}(4-3 z)=z \cdot z \cdot z(4-3 z) \leq\left(\frac{z+z+z+4-3 z}{4}\right)^{4}=1
$$
as required.
Equality occurs if and only if $z=4-3 z$, i.e. $z=1$, i.e. $x=y=1$.

Equality holds when $x = y = 1$, which gives $x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3) = 2$. This is the maximum value of the expression for $x, y > 0$ with $x + y = 2$, so the minimal constant $C$ such that the inequality always holds is $C = 2$.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 2$. 

## Expected Answer
$C = 2$

**Enhanced Solution**

We wish to find the smallest constant C such that for all positive real numbers x,y satisfying x+y=2, the inequality
\[
   x^{3}y^{3}\bigl(x^{3}+y^{3}\bigr) \le C
\]
holds.  We will show that the maximal value of the left–hand side is 2, so that the minimal admissible constant is C=2.

**1. Reduction to a single variable via symmetric sums**

Let us set
\[
   S = x+y,
   
   P = xy.
\]
By hypothesis, S=x+y=2.  Since x,y>0, both S and P are positive.  The arithmetic–geometric mean inequality (AM–GM) applied to x and y gives
\[
   \frac{x+y}{2} \ge \sqrt{xy}
   \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
   1 \ge \sqrt{P}
   \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
   0 < P \le 1.
\]
Hence throughout our analysis we may regard P as a real parameter z in the interval (0,1]:
\[
   z := xy, \quad 0<z\le1.
\]

Next, we rewrite the target expression in terms of S and P.  First observe
\[
   x^{3}+y^{3} 
   = (x+y)\bigl(x^{2}-xy+y^{2}\bigr)
   = S\bigl(S^{2}-3P\bigr)
   = 2\bigl(4-3P\bigr),
\]
since S=2 implies S^2=4.  Therefore
\[
   x^{3}y^{3}\bigl(x^{3}+y^{3}\bigr) 
   = (xy)^{3}\,(x^{3}+y^{3})
   = z^{3}\cdot2\,(4-3z)
   = 2\,z^{3}(4-3z).
\]
Thus it suffices to show
\[
   2\,z^{3}(4-3z) \le C,
   \quad 0<z\le1,
\]
and then choose C as small as possible.

**2. Bounding the single–variable function**

Consider the function
\[
   f(z) = z^{3}(4-3z)
   \quad\text{for }0\le z\le1.
\]
We claim that
\[
   f(z) \le 1 \quad\text{for all }0\le z\le1.
\]

*Justification via AM–GM.*  Note that for 0\le z\le1 we have 4-3z\ge1, so the four nonnegative numbers z,z,z,\,(4-3z) are well defined.  The arithmetic–geometric mean inequality yields
\[
   \frac{z + z + z + (4-3z)}{4}
   \ge 
   \bigl(z\cdot z\cdot z\cdot(4-3z)\bigr)^{1/4}.
\]
The sum in the numerator is z+z+z+(4-3z)=4, so the left side equals 1.  Hence
\[
   1 \ge \bigl(z^{3}(4-3z)\bigr)^{1/4}.
\]
Raising both sides to the fourth power (which preserves the inequality since both sides are nonnegative) gives
\[
   1 \ge z^{3}(4-3z)
   \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
   f(z) \le 1.
\]
Equality in the AM–GM step occurs precisely when all four terms are equal:
\[
   z = z = z = 4-3z
   \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
   z = 4-3z
   \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
   z = 1.
\]

Therefore
\[
   f(z) \le 1 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad 2\,f(z) \le 2,
\]
and the original expression satisfies
\[
   x^{3}y^{3}(x^{3}+y^{3}) 
   = 2\,z^{3}(4-3z)
   \le 2.
\]
The maximum value 2 is attained exactly when z=1, i.e. xy=1 and x+y=2.  Solving these two equations in positive reals forces x=y=1.

**3. Conclusion**

We have shown that for all x,y>0 with x+y=2,
\[
   x^{3}y^{3}(x^{3}+y^{3}) \le 2,
\]
and that 2 is the smallest constant for which this inequality holds (since equality is achieved at x=y=1).  Hence the minimal constant C is

**The answer is $C=2$.**
