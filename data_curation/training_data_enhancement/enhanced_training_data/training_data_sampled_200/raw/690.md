## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be real numbers different from 1, such that $a + b + c = 1$. Consider the following expressions:
$$
\frac{1 + a^{2}}{1 - a^{2}} + \frac{1 + b^{2}}{1 - b^{2}} + \frac{1 + c^{2}}{1 - c^{2}} \quad () \quad \frac{15}{4}
$$
Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
Since $a, b, c>0, a \neq 1, b \neq 1, c \neq 1$ and $a+b+c=1$ it follows that $0<a, b, c<1$.

The given inequality is symmetric, so without loss of generality we may assume that $a \leq b \leq c$.

Then we have
$$
1+a^{2} \leq 1+b^{2} \leq 1+c^{2} \quad \text { and } \quad 1-c^{2} \leq 1-b^{2} \leq 1-a^{2}
$$

Hence
$$
\frac{1}{1-a^{2}} \leq \frac{1}{1-b^{2}} \leq \frac{1}{1-c^{2}}
$$

Now by Chebishev's inequality we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
A & =\frac{1+a^{2}}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1+b^{2}}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1+c^{2}}{1-c^{2}} \\
& \geq \frac{1}{3}\left(1+a^{2}+1+b^{2}+1+c^{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-c^{2}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e.
$$
\begin{equation*}
A \geq \frac{\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+3\right)}{3}\left(\frac{1}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-c^{2}}\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Also we have the well-known inequality
$$
a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2} \geq \frac{(a+b+c)^{2}}{3}=\frac{1}{3}
$$

Therefore by (1) we obtain
$$
\begin{equation*}
A \geq \frac{(1 / 3+3)}{3}\left(\frac{1}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-c^{2}}\right)=\frac{10}{9}\left(\frac{1}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-c^{2}}\right) \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $1-a^{2}, 1-b^{2}, 1-c^{2}>0$, by using $A M \geq H M$ we deduce
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-c^{2}} \geq \frac{9}{3-\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)} \geq \frac{9}{3-1 / 3}=\frac{27}{8} \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

Finally from (2) and (3) we get
$$
A \geq \frac{10}{9}\left(\frac{1}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-c^{2}}\right) \geq \frac{10}{9} \cdot \frac{27}{8}=\frac{15}{4}
$$
with equality iff $a=b=c=1 / 3$. Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Detailed Solution:

1.  Domain and preliminary observations
   • Since a + b + c = 1 and each of a, b, c is real and not equal to 1, we first show that in fact 0 < a, b, c < 1.  Indeed, if one of them were negative or ≥1, the sum of the other two could not bring the total to exactly 1 without violating the restriction that none equals 1.
   • Hence 0 < a, b, c < 1, so all quantities 1 – a^2, 1 – b^2, 1 – c^2 are strictly positive.

2.  Ordering of sequences
   • Without loss of generality assume a ≤ b ≤ c.  Then a^2 ≤ b^2 ≤ c^2, so
       1 + a^2 ≤ 1 + b^2 ≤ 1 + c^2,
       1 – c^2 ≤ 1 – b^2 ≤ 1 – a^2.
   • Since all denominators are positive, taking reciprocals reverses the second chain, giving
       1∕(1 – a^2) ≤ 1∕(1 – b^2) ≤ 1∕(1 – c^2).
   • We now have two sequences of three real numbers, (1 + a^2), (1 + b^2), (1 + c^2) and their corresponding reciprocals, both arranged in nondecreasing order.

3.  Application of Chebyshev’s Inequality
   • Chebyshev’s inequality for three reals x₁ ≤ x₂ ≤ x₃ and y₁ ≤ y₂ ≤ y₃ states that
       (x₁y₁ + x₂y₂ + x₃y₃) ≥ (1/3)(x₁ + x₂ + x₃)(y₁ + y₂ + y₃).
   • Taking xᵢ = 1 + {a, b, c}^2 and yᵢ = 1∕(1 – {a, b, c}^2), we obtain
     A := (1 + a^2)/(1 – a^2) + (1 + b^2)/(1 – b^2) + (1 + c^2)/(1 – c^2)
       ≥ (1/3)[(1 + a^2) + (1 + b^2) + (1 + c^2)]·[1∕(1 – a^2) + 1∕(1 – b^2) + 1∕(1 – c^2)].
   • Write S₁ = a^2 + b^2 + c^2.  Then (1 + a^2)+(1 + b^2)+(1 + c^2) = 3 + S₁.  Hence
       A ≥ ((3 + S₁)/3) · (sum of reciprocals).

4.  Lower bound for S₁ = a^2 + b^2 + c^2
   • By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality or RMS–AM, (1^2 +1^2+1^2)(a^2+b^2+c^2) ≥ (a+b+c)^2 = 1,
     so S₁ ≥ 1/3.
   • Therefore (3 + S₁)/3 ≥ (3 + 1/3)/3 = (10/3)/3 = 10/9.  Substituting,
       A ≥ (10/9) · (1∕(1 – a^2) + 1∕(1 – b^2) + 1∕(1 – c^2)).     (I)

5.  Lower bound for the sum of reciprocals via AM–HM
   • For three positive numbers u, v, w, the AM–HM inequality states
       (u + v + w)/3 ≥ 3/(1/u + 1/v + 1/w),
     or equivalently 1/u + 1/v + 1/w ≥ 9/(u + v + w).
   • Here take u = 1 – a^2, v = 1 – b^2, w = 1 – c^2, so
       1∕(1 – a^2) + 1∕(1 – b^2) + 1∕(1 – c^2)
         ≥ 9/[ (1 – a^2) + (1 – b^2) + (1 – c^2) ]
         = 9/[ 3 – (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ]
         ≤ 9/[ 3 – (1/3) ] = 9/(8/3) = 27/8.     (II)
   • Note the inequality direction: since S₁ ≥ 1/3, the denominator 3 – S₁ ≤ 3 – (1/3) = 8/3, making the fraction at least 27/8.

6.  Combining (I) and (II)
   • From (I) we have A ≥ (10/9) · [sum of reciprocals], and from (II) that sum of reciprocals ≥ 27/8.
   • Hence
       A ≥ (10/9) · (27/8) = 270/72 = 15/4.

7.  Conditions for equality
   • Equality in Chebyshev occurs exactly when the two sequences are constant multiples of each other, here forcing a^2 = b^2 = c^2.
   • Equality in Cauchy–Schwarz (or RMS–AM) and in AM–HM also requires a = b = c.
   • Together with a + b + c = 1, this gives a = b = c = 1/3.

Conclusion: For all real a, b, c ≠ 1 with a + b + c = 1, we have
   (1 + a^2)/(1 – a^2) + (1 + b^2)/(1 – b^2) + (1 + c^2)/(1 – c^2) ≥ 15/4,
with equality iff a = b = c = 1/3.

The answer is (B) ≥
