## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a+b+c \geq \frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}$. Consider the following expressions:
$$
a+b+c \quad () \quad \frac{3}{a+b+c}+\frac{2}{a b c}
$$
Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
By $A M \geq H M$ we get
$$
a+b+c \geq \frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c} \geq \frac{9}{a+b+c}
$$
i.e.
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \frac{3}{a+b+c} \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

We will prove that
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{2(a+b+c)}{3} \geq \frac{2}{a b c} \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$
i.e.
$$
a+b+c \geq \frac{3}{a b c}
$$

Using the well-known inequality $(x y+y z+z x)^{2} \geq 3(x y+y z+z x)$ we obtain
$$
(a+b+c)^{2} \geq\left(\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right)^{2} \geq 3\left(\frac{1}{a b}+\frac{1}{b c}+\frac{1}{c a}\right)=3 \frac{a+b+c}{a b c}
$$
i.e.
$$
a+b+c \geq \frac{3}{a b c}
$$

After adding (1) and (2) we get the required inequality. Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We are given positive real numbers a,b,c satisfying

  (H)   a + b + c \ge 1/a + 1/b + 1/c.

We wish to compare

  E₁ := a+b+c
  \quad
  E₂ := 3/(a+b+c) + 2/(a b c)

and to determine which of the symbols \{≤, ≥, =, <, >\} makes the true statement

  a+b+c  (?)  3/(a+b+c) + 2/(a b c).

The original solution proceeds by splitting the task into two inequalities and then summing them. We now give a more detailed justification of each step, without changing the overall strategy.

Step 1.  Derive an auxiliary lower bound for 1/a + 1/b + 1/c.

By the classical arithmetic–harmonic mean inequality (AM–HM) for the three positive numbers a,b,c, we have

  (a + b + c)/3  ≥  3 / (1/a + 1/b + 1/c).

Rearranging this gives

  1/a + 1/b + 1/c  ≥  9 / (a + b + c).

Since we also know from (H) that

  a + b + c  ≥  1/a + 1/b + 1/c,

we obtain the chain of inequalities

  a + b + c  ≥  1/a + 1/b + 1/c  ≥  9/(a + b + c).

In particular, the first and last terms yield

  a + b + c  ≥  9/(a + b + c).

Divide both sides by 3 (noting positivity of a+b+c) to get

  (1)   (a+b+c)/3  ≥  3/(a+b+c).

Step 2.  Prove a complementary bound involving 1/(a b c).

We now show

  (2)   (2/3)(a+b+c)  ≥  2/(a b c),

or equivalently (after multiplying both sides by 3/2)

  a + b + c  ≥  3/(a b c).

To establish this, apply the Cauchy–Schwarz (or AM–GM) inequality to the three positive numbers 1/a,1/b,1/c in the form

  (1/a + 1/b + 1/c)²  ≥  3·[1/(a b) + 1/(b c) + 1/(c a)].

But observe that

  1/(a b) + 1/(b c) + 1/(c a)
    = (b + c + a)/(a b c)
    = (a + b + c)/(a b c).

Thus

  (1/a + 1/b + 1/c)²  ≥  3·(a + b + c)/(a b c).

On the other hand, from (H) we already have

  1/a + 1/b + 1/c  ≤  a + b + c.

Therefore,

  (a + b + c)²  ≥  (1/a + 1/b + 1/c)²  ≥  3·(a + b + c)/(a b c).

Since a + b + c > 0, we may divide by a + b + c to conclude

  a + b + c  ≥  3/(a b c),

which is exactly the equivalent form of (2).

Step 3.  Combine (1) and (2).

Inequalities (1) and (2) read respectively

  (a+b+c)/3  ≥  3/(a+b+c),

  (2/3)(a+b+c)  ≥  2/(a b c).

Add them term by term:

  [(a+b+c)/3]  +  [(2/3)(a+b+c)]
  ≥  3/(a+b+c)  +  2/(a b c).

The left–hand side simplifies:

  (a+b+c)/3 + 2(a+b+c)/3  =  (a+b+c)·[(1+2)/3]  =  a+b+c.

Hence we obtain the single combined inequality

  a + b + c  ≥  3/(a + b + c) + 2/(a b c).

This shows that among the five choices (A)≤, (B)≥, (C)=, (D)<, (E)>, the correct relational symbol is ≥.

Therefore, in the required format,

The answer is (B) ≥
