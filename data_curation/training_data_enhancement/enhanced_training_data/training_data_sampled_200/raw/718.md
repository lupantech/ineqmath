## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers. Consider the following inequality:
$$
\frac{a^{2}+c^{2}}{b}+\frac{b^{2}+a^{2}}{c}+\frac{c^{2}+b^{2}}{a} \quad () \quad 2(a+b+c) .
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
Since the given inequality is symmetric, without loss of generality we may assume that $a \geq b \geq c$. Then clearly
$$
a^{2} \geq b^{2} \geq c^{2} \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{1}{c} \geq \frac{1}{b} \geq \frac{1}{a}
$$

By the rearrangement inequality we have
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{a^{2}}{b}+\frac{b^{2}}{c}+\frac{c^{2}}{a}=a^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{b}+b^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{c}+c^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{a} \geq a^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{a}+b^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{b}+c^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{c}=a+b+c \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$
and
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{a^{2}}{c}+\frac{b^{2}}{a}+\frac{c^{2}}{b}=a^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{c}+b^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{a}+c^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{b} \geq a^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{a}+b^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{b}+c^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{c}=a+b+c \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Adding (1) and (2) yields the required inequality.
Equality occurs if and only if $a=b=c$. Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to determine which of the relations “≤, ≥, =, <, >” correctly completes the inequality

  (a² + c²)/b  ■  2(a + b + c)

where a, b, c are arbitrary positive real numbers.  We shall show by a classical application of the rearrangement inequality that

  (a² + c²)/b  +  (b² + a²)/c  +  (c² + b²)/a  ≥  2(a + b + c),

and hence the correct symbol ■ is “≥”.

Step 1.  Symmetry and ordering.
Because the left–hand side (LHS)

  LHS  =  (a² + c²)/b  +  (b² + a²)/c  +  (c² + b²)/a

is symmetric in a, b, c (i.e.\/ invariant under any permutation of the three variables), we lose no generality by imposing an order on them.  Precisely, we may assume

  a  ≥  b  ≥  c  >  0.

Under this assumption,

  a²  ≥  b²  ≥  c²,
  1/b  ≥  1/c  ≥  1/a

since taking reciprocals reverses the order of positive numbers.

Step 2.  First application of the rearrangement inequality.
Split the LHS into two cyclic sums:

  S₁ =  a²/b  +  b²/c  +  c²/a,
  S₂ =  a²/c  +  b²/a  +  c²/b.

We first estimate S₁.  Consider the two real sequences

  X  =  (a², b², c²),   sorted non-increasing,
  Y  =  (1/b, 1/c, 1/a), sorted non-increasing.

By the rearrangement inequality, among all ways of pairing the terms of X with those of Y, the term-by-term product sum is minimized when X and Y are oppositely sorted and is maximized when they are similarly sorted.  Here X and Y are *similarly* sorted in non-increasing order, so the *maximum* of

  Σ X_i · Y_{π(i)}

over all permutations π of {1,2,3} is attained when we pair in order:

  a²·(1/b)  +  b²·(1/c)  +  c²·(1/a)

is at least as large as the “aligned” product sum

  a²·(1/a)  +  b²·(1/b)  +  c²·(1/c)
  =  a + b + c.

Hence

  S₁  =  a²/b  +  b²/c  +  c²/a  ≥  a + b + c.        (1)

Step 3.  Second application of the rearrangement inequality.
By exactly the same reasoning—merely permuting which denominators we pair—we obtain

  S₂  =  a²/c  +  b²/a  +  c²/b  ≥  a + b + c.        (2)

Step 4.  Combining the two estimates.
Adding (1) and (2) gives

  S₁ + S₂  ≥  (a + b + c) + (a + b + c)
  ⇒  (a² + c²)/b  +  (b² + a²)/c  +  (c² + b²)/a  ≥  2(a + b + c).

Step 5.  Equality case.
The rearrangement inequality yields equality if and only if the two sequences in question are constant or one is a permutation of the other.  In our context, this forces

  a² = b² = c²  ⇒  a = b = c

(since a,b,c>0).  Thus equality in the original inequality holds precisely when a=b=c.

Conclusion.  The correct relation is “≥”.

The answer is (B) ≥
