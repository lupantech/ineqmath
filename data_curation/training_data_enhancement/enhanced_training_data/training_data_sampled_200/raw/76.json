We compute its second derivative:\n      φ′(x) = 3x²,\n      φ″(x) = 6x.\n   Since x > 0 on the domain (0, +∞), we have φ″(x) = 6x > 0 for all x > 0.  Therefore φ is strictly convex on (0, +∞).\n\n2. Application of Jensen’s inequality\n   For any convex function φ and any weights λ₁, λ₂ ≥ 0 with λ₁ + λ₂ = 1, Jensen’s inequality states\n      φ(λ₁ a + λ₂ b) ≤ λ₁ φ(a) + λ₂ φ(b).\n   Take λ₁ = λ₂ = 1/2.  Then λ₁ a + λ₂ b = (a + b)/2, and Jensen gives\n      φ((a + b)/2) ≤ (1/2) φ(a) + (1/2) φ(b)\n   or explicitly\n      ((a + b)/2)³ ≤ (a³ + b³)/2.\n\n3. Algebraic rearrangement to the desired form\n   Multiply both sides of ((a + b)/2)³ ≤ (a³ + b³)/2 by 8 to clear the denominator:  \n      8 · ((a + b)/2)³ ≤ 8 · ((a³ + b³)/2)\n      ⇒ (a + b)³ ≤ 4 (a³ + b³).\n   Thus for all a, b > 0 one has\n      4 (a³ + b³) ≥ (a + b)³.\n   In other words, the inequality C (a³ + b³) ≥ (a + b)³ holds with C = 4.\n\n4. Sharpness and minimality of the constant\n   To see that 4 is the smallest possible constant C, we check the equality case in Jensen’s inequality.  Equality holds if and only if a = b (since φ is strictly convex).  When a = b, say a = b = t > 0, both sides become:\n      Left side:  4 (t³ + t³) = 8 t³,\n      Right side: (t + t)³ = (2t)³ = 8 t³.\n   Hence C cannot be taken smaller than 4 without violating the inequality for a = b.\n\n5. Conclusion\n   Combining existence (C = 4 works) and minimality (no smaller C works), we conclude that the smallest constant is C = 4.\n\nThe answer is $C=4$",
