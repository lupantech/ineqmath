## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$:
$$
a b \frac{a+c}{b+c}+b c \frac{b+a}{c+a}+c a \frac{c+b}{a+b} \geq C \sqrt{a b c(a+b+c)}
$$

## Current Solution
Let $x=\frac{1}{b c}, y=\frac{1}{a c}, z=\frac{1}{a b}$ and $A=a c, B=a b, C=b c$.
We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{x}{y+z}(B+C) & =a b \frac{a+c}{b+c}, \quad \frac{y}{z+x}(C+A)=b c \frac{b+a}{c+a} \quad \text { and } \\
\frac{z}{x+y}(A+B) & =c a \frac{c+b}{a+b}
\end{aligned}
$$

Using Corollary Let $a, b, c$ and $x, y, z$ be positive real numbers. Then
$$
\frac{x}{y+z}(b+c)+\frac{y}{z+x}(c+a)+\frac{z}{x+y}(a+b) \geq \sqrt{3(a b+b c+c a)}
$$
and the previous identities we obtain
$$
\begin{aligned}
& a b \frac{a+c}{b+c}+b c \frac{b+a}{c+a}+c a \frac{c+b}{a+b} \\
& \quad=\frac{x}{y+z}(B+C)+\frac{y}{z+x}(C+A)+\frac{z}{x+y}(A+B) \\
& \quad \geq \sqrt{3(A B+B C+C A)}=\sqrt{3 a b c(a+b+c)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Equality holds when $a = b = c$, since in this case all terms are equal and the inequality becomes an equality. This gives the minimum value of the left-hand side, so $C = \sqrt{3}$ is the largest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \sqrt{3}$.

## Expected Answer
$C = \sqrt{3}$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that for all positive real numbers a,b,c the following inequality holds, and to determine the best (largest) constant C:

  (1)   a b ·(a + c)/(b + c)   +   b c ·(b + a)/(c + a)   +   c a ·(c + b)/(a + b)
        ≥ C · √[a b c (a + b + c)].

We shall prove the inequality with C = √3 and show that no larger C can work.  The proof proceeds by a classical substitution that transforms the left–hand side into a form amenable to a known weighted‐Cauchy–Schwarz bound.

Step 1.  Introduce the reciprocal variables

  x = 1/(b c),   y = 1/(c a),   z = 1/(a b).

Since a,b,c>0, each of x,y,z is positive.  Also set

  A = a c,   B = a b,   C' = b c.

Observe that B = a b, C' = b c, A = c a.

Step 2.  Rewrite each term on the left–hand side of (1).  For the first term,

  a b ·(a + c)/(b + c)
  = B · (a + c)/(b + c)
  = B · [ (a c)/(c b) + (c c)/(c b ) ]
    after multiplying numerator and denominator by c,

  = B · [ A x + C' x ]      because x = 1/(b c)
  = x · (B + C').

Similarly, for the second term,

  b c ·(b + a)/(c + a)
  = C' · (b + a)/(c + a)
  = C' · [ (b a)/(a c) + (a a)/(a c) ]
  = C' · [ B y + A y ]  = y · (C' + A),

and for the third term,

  c a ·(c + b)/(a + b)
  = A · (c + b)/(a + b)
  = A · [ (c b)/(b a) + (b b)/(b a) ]
  = A · [ C' z + B z ]  = z · (A + B).

Hence the entire left–hand side of (1) becomes

  x·(B + C')   +   y·(C' + A)   +   z·(A + B).

Step 3.  Apply the following corollary of the Cauchy–Schwarz (or Titu’s) inequality:

  For any positive a,b,c and any positive x,y,z,

    x·(b + c)   +   y·(c + a)   +   z·(a + b)
    ≥ √[ 3 · (a b + b c + c a) ].

In our situation we identify the pairings

   (b + c) ↔ (B + C'),   (c + a) ↔ (C' + A),   (a + b) ↔ (A + B),

so that the sum x·(B + C') + y·(C' + A) + z·(A + B) satisfies exactly the hypothesis of the corollary with the roles of (a,b,c) in the corollary replaced by (B,C',A).  Therefore,

  x·(B + C')   +   y·(C' + A)   +   z·(A + B)
  ≥ √[ 3 · (B·C' + C'·A + A·B ) ].

Step 4.  Observe that

  B·C' + C'·A + A·B
  = (a b)(b c) + (b c)(c a) + (c a)(a b)
  = a b c · (a + b + c).

Hence the right–hand side becomes

  √[ 3 · a b c · (a + b + c) ]
  = √3 · √[ a b c (a + b + c) ].

Combining these steps we arrive at the inequality

  a b·(a+c)/(b+c) + b c·(b+a)/(c+a) + c a·(c+b)/(a+b)
  ≥ √3 · √[ a b c (a + b + c) ],

valid for all positive a,b,c.

Step 5.  Sharpness and determination of the best constant.  Equality in the Cauchy–Schwarz–type corollary occurs precisely when

   x : y : z  =  (b + c) : (c + a) : (a + b)

and also when the three “paired’’ terms themselves are proportional.  In our substitution one checks that this condition forces a = b = c, which in turn gives x = y = z.  Thus equality in the original inequality holds exactly at a = b = c, proving that no larger constant than √3 can work.

Therefore the largest constant C for which (1) always holds is √3.

The answer is $C=\sqrt{3}$.
