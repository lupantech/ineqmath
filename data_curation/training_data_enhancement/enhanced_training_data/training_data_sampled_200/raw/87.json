    "enhanced_solution": "Enhanced Solution:\n\nLet a, b, c be the side lengths of a triangle.  Our goal is to show that for all such triples \\(a,b,c\\),\n\n\\[ (a+b-c)\\,(b+c-a)\\,(c+a-b) \\le C\\,a\\,b\\,c, \\]\n\nand to determine the smallest constant \\(C\\) for which this inequality always holds.\n\n1.  Positivity of the factors.  Since \\(a,b,c\\) are sides of a triangle, the usual triangle inequalities\n\n\\[ a < b + c, \\quad b < c + a, \\quad c < a + b \\]\n\nimply in particular\n\n\\[ a + b - c > 0, \\quad b + c - a > 0, \\quad c + a - b > 0. \\]\n\nThus every factor on the left–hand side of the target inequality is strictly positive.\n\n2.  Factorization via the difference of squares.  Observe the algebraic identity\n\n\\[ a^2 - (b - c)^2 = \\bigl(a - (b-c)\\bigr)\\,\\bigl(a + (b-c)\\bigr) = (a + b - c)\\,(a + c - b). \\]\n\n3.  Applying the triangle inequality.  From \\(a < b + c\\) we get \\(a > |b - c|\\), and hence\n\n\\[ a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\;\\ge\\; 0 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad a^2 \\ge (b - c)^2. \\]\n\nCombining this with the factorization in step 2 yields\n\n\\[ (a + b - c)\\,(a + c - b) \n   = a^2 - (b - c)^2\n   \\le a^2. \\]\n\n4.  Cyclic analogues.  By exactly the same reasoning—interchanging the roles of \\(a,b,c\\)—we obtain\n\n\\[ (b + c - a)\\,(b + a - c) \\le b^2,\n   \\quad (c + a - b)\\,(c + b - a) \\le c^2. \\]\n\n5.  Multiplying the three inequalities.  Since all factors involved are positive, we may multiply the three estimates:\n\n\\[\n(a + b - c)\\,(a + c - b)\n\\;\\times\\;\n(b + c - a)\\,(b + a - c)\n\\;\\times\\;\n(c + a - b)\\,(c + b - a)\n\\;\n\\le\\;\n a^2\\,b^2\\,c^2.\n\\]\n\nRearranging the left side shows that each of the six factors \\((a+b-c),(b+c-a),(c+a-b)\\) appears exactly twice, so\n\n\\[\n\\bigl[(a + b - c)\\,(b + c - a)\\,(c + a - b)\\bigr]^2 \\le a^2\\,b^2\\,c^2.\n\\]\n\n6.  Taking positive square roots.  All factors are positive (from step 1), so we may safely take the positive square root of both sides and conclude\n\n\\[\n(a + b - c)\\,(b + c - a)\\,(c + a - b)\n\\;\\le\\;\na\\,b\\,c.\n\\]\n\n7.  Determination of the best constant and the case of equality.  The above shows the inequality holds with \\(C = 1\\).  To see that no smaller constant can work, observe that when \\(a = b = c\\) (the equilateral triangle) both sides become\n\n\\[ (a+a-a)^3 = a^3 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad a\\,a\\,a = a^3, \\]\n\nso equality is attained.  Hence the minimal possible \\(C\\) is exactly 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $C=1$",
