## Problem
Let $P, L, R$ denote the area, perimeter, and circumradius of $\triangle ABC$, respectively. Find the smallest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all triangles $\triangle ABC$:
$$
\frac{L P}{R^3} \leq C.
$$

## Current Solution
We have
$$
\frac{L P}{R^{3}}=\frac{(a+b+c) a b c}{R^{3} 4 R}=\frac{2 R(\sin \alpha+\sin \beta+\sin \gamma) 8 R^{3} \sin \alpha \sin \beta \sin \gamma}{4 R^{4}}
$$
i.e.
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{L P}{R^{3}}=4(\sin \alpha+\sin \beta+\sin \gamma) \sin \alpha \sin \beta \sin \gamma \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

By $A M \geq G M$ we have
$$
\sin \alpha \sin \beta \sin \gamma \leq\left(\frac{\sin \alpha+\sin \beta+\sin \gamma}{3}\right)^{3}
$$

So by (1) we get
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{L P}{R^{3}} \leq \frac{4(\sin \alpha+\sin \beta+\sin \gamma)^{4}}{27} \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

The function $f(x)=-\sin x$ is convex on $[0, \pi]$, so by Jensen's inequality we have
$$
\frac{\sin \alpha+\sin \beta+\sin \gamma}{3} \leq \sin \left(\frac{\alpha+\beta+\gamma}{3}\right)=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
$$

Finally from (2) we obtain
$$
\frac{L P}{R^{3}} \leq \frac{4}{27}\left(\frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^{4}=\frac{27}{4}
$$

Equality holds when $a = b = c$, i.e., when the triangle is equilateral. In this case, the maximum value of $\frac{L P}{R^3}$ is achieved, so $C = \frac{27}{4}$ is the smallest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \frac{27}{4}$.

## Expected Answer
$C = \frac{27}{4}$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to find the smallest constant C such that for every triangle ABC with side‐lengths a,b,c, perimeter L=a+b+c, area P, and circumradius R, the following holds:

  (★) L·P / R³ ≤ C.

Our strategy is to express L·P / R³ in terms of the triangle’s angles, then apply classical inequalities (AM–GM and Jensen) to obtain an upper bound, and finally determine the exact constant C and the condition for equality.

Step 1: Expressing L and P via the sides and circumradius
-----------------------------------------------------------------
By definition, the perimeter is
  L = a + b + c.
The area P can be written using the extended law of sines:
  P = (a·b·c) / (4R).
Hence
  L·P = (a+b+c)·(a·b·c) / (4R).
Dividing by R³ gives
  L·P / R³ = (a+b+c)·(a·b·c) / (4R·R³)
            = (a+b+c)·(a·b·c) / (4R⁴).

Step 2: Introducing the angles via the Law of Sines
-----------------------------------------------------------------
By the Law of Sines, for each angle A, B, C of triangle ABC we have
  a = 2R·sin A,
  b = 2R·sin B,
  c = 2R·sin C,
and the angles satisfy A+B+C = π, with 0 < A,B,C < π.

Substitute these into the expression for L·P / R³:
  a·b·c = (2R·sin A)(2R·sin B)(2R·sin C) = 8R³·(sin A·sin B·sin C),
  a + b + c = 2R·(sin A + sin B + sin C).
Therefore,
  L·P / R³
    = [2R (sin A+sin B+sin C) · 8R³ (sin A·sin B·sin C)] / [4R⁴]
    = [16 R⁴·(sin A+sin B+sin C)·(sin A·sin B·sin C)] / [4R⁴]
    = 4·(sin A + sin B + sin C)·(sin A·sin B·sin C).

Let us denote
  S = sin A + sin B + sin C,
  Pₛ = sin A·sin B·sin C.
Then
  (1) L·P / R³ = 4·S·Pₛ.

Step 3: Applying the AM–GM inequality to the sines
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Since A, B, C ∈ (0,π), each sin A, sin B, sin C is positive. By the arithmetic–geometric mean inequality,
  (sin A · sin B · sin C) ≤ [(sin A + sin B + sin C) / 3]³.
Hence
  Pₛ ≤ (S / 3)³,
and from (1)
  L·P / R³ = 4·S·Pₛ ≤ 4·S·(S/3)³ = (4 / 27)·S⁴.
We have thus established
  (2) L·P / R³ ≤ (4 / 27) · S⁴.

Equality in the AM–GM step occurs precisely when
  sin A = sin B = sin C,
which (since A,B,C ∈ (0,π) and sum to π) forces A = B = C = π/3 (the equilateral case).

Step 4: Bounding S = sin A + sin B + sin C via Jensen’s inequality
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The function φ(x)=sin x is concave on [0,π]. By Jensen’s inequality for concave φ,
  [φ(A) + φ(B) + φ(C)] / 3 ≤ φ((A+B+C)/3).
Since A+B+C=π, we get
  (sin A + sin B + sin C)/3 ≤ sin(π/3) = √3/2.
Thus
  S ≤ 3·(√3/2) = (3√3)/2.

Substitute this into (2):
  L·P / R³ ≤ (4 / 27) · [(3√3)/2]⁴.
Compute (3√3/2)⁴:
  (3√3/2)² = (9·3)/4 = 27/4,
  (3√3/2)⁴ = (27/4)² = 729/16.
Therefore,
  L·P / R³ ≤ (4 / 27) · (729/16)
            = (4·729) / (27·16)
            = (2916) / (432)
            = 27/4.

Step 5: Conclusion and determination of the smallest constant
-----------------------------------------------------------------
We have shown for all triangles ABC,
  L·P / R³ ≤ 27/4.
Moreover, equality occurs exactly when A = B = C = π/3, i.e. the triangle is equilateral. Hence 27/4 is the least possible constant C satisfying (★).

Final Answer:

The answer is $C=\frac{27}{4}$
