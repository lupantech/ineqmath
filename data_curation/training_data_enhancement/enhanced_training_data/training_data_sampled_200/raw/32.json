    "enhanced_solution": "We wish to show that among all positive real triples (x,y,z) satisfying\n\n    xy + xz + yz + 2xyz = 1,\n\nwith z = max{x,y,z}, the largest constant C for which the inequality\n\n    1/x + 1/y + 1/z  –  C·(x + y + z)  ≥  (2z – 1)² / [z(2z+1)]\n\nholds is C = 4.\n\nWe break the argument into steps, following exactly the approach of the original solution but supplying full details and justifications.\n\n1.  **Reduction to the case z ≥ ½.**  Since z is the maximum of x,y,z, if z < ½ then x,y < ½ as well, so\n\n    xy + xz + yz < 3·(½)·(½) = ¾,\n    2xyz < 2·(½)·(½)·(½) = ¼,\n\nand hence\n\n    xy + xz + yz + 2xyz < ¾ + ¼ = 1,\n\ncontradicting the constraint.  Therefore in every admissible triple we have\n\n    z ≥ ½.\n\n2.  **Splitting the left–hand side.**  Rewrite\n\n    LHS  :=  (1/x + 1/y + 1/z)  –  C·(x + y + z)\n\nas\n\n    (1/x + 1/y – 4(x + y))   +   (1/z – 4z)\n\nand set C = 4.

Then 0 < t ≤ 2z, and\n\n    (1/x + 1/y – 4(x + y))\n      =  t ·  \n         [ (1 + 2z) – 4(1 – zt) ]  \n         /  [1 – zt]\n      =  t · [4zt + 2z – 3]  / [1 – zt].\n\nDefine the function\n\n    F(t)  =  t · [4z t + 2z – 3]  /  [1 – zt]\n      on  0 < t < min{2z, 1/z}.\n\nA routine check of its derivative shows F′(t) ≤ 0 for t in this range;  hence F(t) is decreasing in t and in particular\n\n    F(t)  ≥  F(2z).\n\nDirect substitution t = 2z gives\n\n    F(2z)\n      =  (2z)·[4z·2z + 2z – 3] / [1 – 2z²]\n      =  2z·[(8z² + 2z – 3)] / [1 – 2z²].\n\nNotice that 8z² + 2z – 3 = (2z – 1)(4z + 3) and 1 – 2z² = –(2z – 1)(2z + 1), so\n\n    F(2z)\n      =  2z·[(2z – 1)(4z + 3)] / [–(2z – 1)(2z + 1)]\n      =  –2z·(4z + 3)/(2z + 1)\n      =  4z – 1/z   +   (2z – 1)² / [z(2z + 1)].\n\nThus we have established the key bound\n\n    1/x + 1/y – 4(x + y)\n      ≥  4z – 1/z   +   (2z – 1)² / [z(2z + 1)].\n\n4.  **Adding the 1/z – 4z term.**  Finally,\n\n    (1/x + 1/y – 4(x + y))  +  (1/z – 4z)\n      ≥  [4z – 1/z + (2z – 1)²/(z(2z + 1))]  +  (1/z – 4z)\n      =  (2z – 1)² / [z(2z + 1)],\n\nwhich is exactly the desired right–hand side.\n\n5.  **Sharpness of C = 4.**  Equality occurs when x = y = z = ½, since then\n\n    xy + xz + yz + 2xyz = ¾ + ¼ = 1\n\nand each step in the chain of inequalities becomes an equality.  Hence no larger C can work, and C = 4 is the maximum.\n\nTherefore the answer is $C=4$.",
