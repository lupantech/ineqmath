## Problem
Let $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ be positive real numbers such that $a_{1} + a_{2} + \cdots + a_{n} = 1$. Consider the following expressions:
$$
a_{1}^{-k} + a_{2}^{-k} + \cdots + a_{n}^{-k} \quad () \quad n^{k+1}
$$
Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
Since $A M \geq G M$ we have
$$
\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}} \leq \frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}}{n}=\frac{1}{n}
$$
or
$$
n \leq \sqrt[n]{\frac{1}{a_{1}} \frac{1}{a_{2}} \cdots \frac{1}{a_{n}}}
$$

Hence
$$
n^{k} \leq \sqrt[n]{a_{1}^{-k} a_{2}^{-k} \cdots a_{n}^{-k}} \leq \frac{a_{1}^{-k}+a_{2}^{-k}+\cdots+a_{n}^{-k}}{n}
$$
i.e.
$$
a_{1}^{-k}+a_{2}^{-k}+\cdots+a_{n}^{-k} \geq n^{k+1}
$$
as required. Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Detailed Solution:

We are given positive real numbers a₁, a₂, …, aₙ satisfying
  a₁ + a₂ + ⋯ + aₙ = 1,
and a fixed positive integer k ∈ ℕ.  We wish to compare
  S = a₁⁻ᵏ + a₂⁻ᵏ + ⋯ + aₙ⁻ᵏ
with
  nᵏ⁺¹.

We will use the classical Arithmetic Mean–Geometric Mean (AM–GM) inequality twice, while keeping track of every logical step.

Step 1: Apply AM–GM to the numbers a₁, a₂, …, aₙ.

  By AM–GM, for n positive numbers x₁,…,xₙ we have
    (x₁⋯xₙ)^{1/n} ≤ (x₁ + ⋯ + xₙ)/n.
  Here we set xᵢ = aᵢ, so
    (a₁a₂⋯aₙ)^{1/n} ≤ (a₁ + a₂ + ⋯ + aₙ)/n = 1/n.
  Raising both sides to the nᵗʰ power yields
    a₁a₂⋯aₙ ≤ n⁻ⁿ.

Step 2: Pass to reciprocals.

  Since each aᵢ > 0, we can invert the inequality
    a₁a₂⋯aₙ ≤ n⁻ⁿ
  to get
    (1/a₁)(1/a₂)⋯(1/aₙ) ≥ nⁿ.

Step 3: Incorporate the exponent k.

  Raise the product of reciprocals to the kᵗʰ power:
    [(1/a₁)(1/a₂)⋯(1/aₙ)]ᵏ ≥ (nⁿ)ᵏ = nⁿᵏ.
  Equivalently,
    (a₁⁻ᵏ)(a₂⁻ᵏ)⋯(aₙ⁻ᵏ) ≥ nⁿᵏ.

Step 4: Compute the geometric mean of the terms aᵢ⁻ᵏ.

  The geometric mean G of the n terms a₁⁻ᵏ, …, aₙ⁻ᵏ is
    G = [(a₁⁻ᵏ)(a₂⁻ᵏ)⋯(aₙ⁻ᵏ)]^{1/n}.
  From the inequality above,
    G ≥ (nⁿᵏ)^{1/n} = nᵏ.

Step 5: Apply AM–GM a second time to the numbers a₁⁻ᵏ, …, aₙ⁻ᵏ.

  By AM–GM,
    (a₁⁻ᵏ + a₂⁻ᵏ + ⋯ + aₙ⁻ᵏ)/n ≥ G.
  Combining with G ≥ nᵏ gives
    (a₁⁻ᵏ + a₂⁻ᵏ + ⋯ + aₙ⁻ᵏ)/n ≥ nᵏ.
  Multiply both sides by n:
    a₁⁻ᵏ + a₂⁻ᵏ + ⋯ + aₙ⁻ᵏ ≥ n·nᵏ = n^{k+1}.

Conclusion:

We have rigorously shown that
  a₁⁻ᵏ + a₂⁻ᵏ + ⋯ + aₙ⁻ᵏ ≥ n^{k+1}.
Therefore, the correct inequality relation is “greater than or equal to.”

The answer is (B) ≥
