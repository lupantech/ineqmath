## Problem
Let $x, y, z$ be positive real numbers such that $xyz = x + y + z + 2$. Find the minimal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x, y, z$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} + \sqrt{z} \leq C \sqrt{xyz}.
$$

## Current Solution
The initial condition $x y z=x+y+z+2$ can be rewritten as follows

$$
\frac{1}{1+x}+\frac{1}{1+y}+\frac{1}{1+z}=1
$$

Now, let

$$
\frac{1}{1+x}=a, \frac{1}{1+y}=b, \frac{1}{1+z}=c
$$

Then

$$
x=\frac{1-a}{a}=\frac{b+c}{a}, y=\frac{c+a}{b}, z=\frac{a+b}{c}
$$

Here we have

$$
\begin{gathered}
\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z} \leq \frac{3}{2} \sqrt{x y z} \Leftrightarrow \\
\Leftrightarrow \sqrt{\frac{a}{b+c} \cdot \frac{b}{c+a}}+\sqrt{\frac{b}{c+a} \cdot \frac{c}{a+b}}+\sqrt{\frac{c}{a+b} \cdot \frac{a}{b+c}} \leq \frac{3}{2}
\end{gathered}
$$

This can be proved by adding the inequality

$$
\sqrt{\frac{a}{b+c} \cdot \frac{b}{c+a}} \leq \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{a}{a+c}+\frac{b}{b+c}\right)
$$

with the analogous ones.

Equality holds when $x = y = z = 2$, which corresponds to $a = b = c = \frac{1}{3}$. In this case, $\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y} + \sqrt{z} = 3\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{xyz} = 2\sqrt{2}$, so $\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}$. Thus, the minimum value of $C$ for which the inequality always holds is $C = \frac{3}{2}$.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \frac{3}{2}$.

## Expected Answer
$C = \frac{3}{2}$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to find the smallest constant C such that for every triple of positive reals (x,y,z) satisfying
  xyz = x + y + z + 2,
the inequality
  √x + √y + √z  ≤  C·√(xyz)
holds.  We will show that Cₘᵢₙ = 3/2.

1.  Reformulation of the constraint
  Starting from
    xyz = x + y + z + 2,
  observe that
    (1 + x)(1 + y)(1 + z)
      = 1 + (x + y + z) + (xy + yz + zx) + xyz
      = 1 + (x + y + z) + (xy + yz + zx) + (x + y + z + 2)
      = 3 + 2(x + y + z) + (xy + yz + zx).
  On the other hand,
    (1 + y)(1 + z) + (1 + z)(1 + x) + (1 + x)(1 + y)
      = [1 + y + z + yz] + [1 + z + x + zx] + [1 + x + y + xy]
      = 3 + 2(x + y + z) + (xy + yz + zx).
  Hence
    (1 + x)(1 + y)(1 + z)  =  (1 + y)(1 + z) + (1 + z)(1 + x) + (1 + x)(1 + y)
  and dividing by (1 + x)(1 + y)(1 + z) gives
    1/(1 + x)  +  1/(1 + y)  +  1/(1 + z)  =  1.

2.  Change of variables
  Set
    a = 1/(1 + x),   b = 1/(1 + y),   c = 1/(1 + z).
  Then a,b,c > 0 and a + b + c = 1.  Inverting, one finds
    x = (1 − a)/a = (b + c)/a,
    y = (1 − b)/b = (c + a)/b,
    z = (1 − c)/c = (a + b)/c.

3.  Rewrite the LHS and RHS in terms of a,b,c
  We have
    √x  +  √y  +  √z
      = √((b + c)/a)  +  √((c + a)/b)  +  √((a + b)/c),
  and
    √(xyz)
      = √[ ((b + c)(c + a)(a + b)) / (abc) ].
  Dividing the sought inequality by √(xyz) is equivalent to showing
    √x/√(xyz)  +  √y/√(xyz)  +  √z/√(xyz)  ≤  C.
  A direct simplification of each term yields—for example—
    √x/√(xyz)
      = √[ (b + c)/a  ·  (abc)/((b + c)(c + a)(a + b)) ]
      = √[ bc / ((c + a)(a + b)) ]
      = √( b/(c + a)  ·  c/(a + b) ).
  Hence the original inequality is equivalent to
    S(a,b,c)  :=  √(a/(b + c) · b/(c + a))
               + √(b/(c + a) · c/(a + b))
               + √(c/(a + b) · a/(b + c))  ≤  C,
  under the condition a,b,c>0, a+b+c=1.

4.  Application of the AM–GM inequality
  For any two nonnegative numbers X,Y,
    √(XY)  ≤  (X + Y)/2.
  Apply this to each term in S(a,b,c):
    √(a/(b + c) · b/(c + a))
      ≤ ½ [ a/(b + c)  +  b/(c + a) ],
  and similarly for the two cyclic permutations.  Adding these three estimates yields
    S(a,b,c)
      ≤  ½ [ (a/(b + c) + b/(c + a))
             + (b/(c + a) + c/(a + b))
             + (c/(a + b) + a/(b + c)) ]
      =   a/(b + c) + b/(c + a) + c/(a + b).
  Denote now
    T(a,b,c)  :=  a/(b + c)  +  b/(c + a)  +  c/(a + b).
  Thus we have shown
    S(a,b,c)  ≤  T(a,b,c)  for all a,b,c > 0 with a + b + c = 1.

5.  Maximization by symmetry (or Lagrange multipliers)
  The function T(a,b,c) is symmetric in a,b,c subject to the linear constraint a+b+c=1.  A standard argument (e.g.\, by symmetry or by the method of Lagrange multipliers) shows that its maximum on the open simplex {a,b,c>0, a+b+c=1} occurs when a = b = c = 1/3.  Substituting gives
    T(1/3,1/3,1/3)
      =  3 · [ (1/3) / (1/3 + 1/3) ]
      =  3 · (1/3) / (2/3)
      =  3 · (1/2)
      =  3/2.
  Hence for all admissible (a,b,c),
    S(a,b,c)  ≤  T(a,b,c)  ≤  3/2.
  It follows that the original inequality holds with C = 3/2, and no smaller constant can work because equality is attained when x=y=z=2 (equivalently a=b=c=1/3).

Conclusion
  The minimal constant C for which
    √x + √y + √z  ≤  C·√(xyz)
  holds under xyz = x + y + z + 2 is

  The answer is $C=\tfrac{3}{2}$
