## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be non-negative real numbers. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$:
$$
\frac{a}{4 b^{2}+b c+4 c^{2}}+\frac{b}{4 c^{2}+c a+4 a^{2}}+\frac{c}{4 a^{2}+a b+4 b^{2}} \geq C \cdot \frac{1}{a+b+c}
$$

## Current Solution
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have
$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{a}{4 b^{2}+b c+4 c^{2}}+\frac{b}{4 c^{2}+c a+4 a^{2}}+\frac{c}{4 a^{2}+a b+4 b^{2}} \\
\geq \frac{(a+b+c)^{2}}{4 a\left(b^{2}+c^{2}\right)+4 b\left(c^{2}+a^{2}\right)+4 c\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\right)+3 a b c}
\end{gathered}
$$

So we need to prove that
$$
\frac{(a+b+c)^{2}}{4 a\left(b^{2}+c^{2}\right)+4 b\left(c^{2}+a^{2}\right)+4 c\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\right)+3 a b c} \geq \frac{1}{a+b+c}
$$
which is equivalent to
$$
(a+b+c)^{3} \geq 4 a\left(b^{2}+c^{2}\right)+4 b\left(c^{2}+a^{2}\right)+4 c\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\right)+3 a b c
$$
i.e.
$$
a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}+3 a b c \geq a\left(b^{2}+c^{2}\right)+b\left(c^{2}+a^{2}\right)+c\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\right)
$$
which is Schur's inequality.

Equality holds when $a = b = c$, for example at $a = b = c > 0$. In this case, both sides of the inequality are equal, so the minimum value of the left side is achieved and $C = 1$ is the largest possible constant.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 1$. 

## Expected Answer
$C = 1$

## Enhanced Solution
**Solution:**

We wish to show that for all nonnegative real numbers a,b,c (not all zero) the following holds:

  (1)   a⁄(4b²+bc+4c²)  +  b⁄(4c²+ca+4a²)  +  c⁄(4a²+ab+4b²)  ≥  C·1⁄(a+b+c)

and to determine the largest constant C for which this inequality is true.

**Step 1.  Application of the Cauchy–Schwarz (Titu’s) inequality.**

Observe that each term on the left can be written in the form p_i²⁄x_i by setting

  p₁ = a,    x₁ = a(4b² + bc + 4c²),
  p₂ = b,    x₂ = b(4c² + ca + 4a²),
  p₃ = c,    x₃ = c(4a² + ab + 4b²).

Since all x_i are strictly positive whenever (a,b,c)≠(0,0,0), we may apply the well‐known Engel form of Cauchy–Schwarz:

  ∑_{i=1}^3 p_i² ⁄ x_i   ≥   (∑_{i=1}^3 p_i)² ⁄ (∑_{i=1}^3 x_i).

Hence

  a⁄(4b²+bc+4c²)  +  b⁄(4c²+ca+4a²)  +  c⁄(4a²+ab+4b²)
  =   a²⁄[a(4b²+bc+4c²)]  +  b²⁄[b(4c²+ca+4a²)]  +  c²⁄[c(4a²+ab+4b²)]
  ≥  (a + b + c)²  ⁄  [∑_{cyc} a(4b² + bc + 4c²)].

**Step 2.  Simplify the denominator.**

Compute

  ∑_{cyc} a(4b² + bc + 4c²)
  =  [4a b² + a b c + 4a c²]
     + [4b c² + b c a + 4b a²]
     + [4c a² + c a b + 4c b²]
  = 4(a²b + ab² + b²c + bc² + c²a + ca²)  + 3abc.

Therefore the left‐hand side of (1) is at least

  (a + b + c)²  ⁄  [4·∑_{sym} a²b  + 3abc].

Thus it suffices to prove

  (a + b + c)²  ⁄  [4·∑_{sym} a²b  + 3abc]
  ≥  1⁄(a + b + c)

for all nonnegative a,b,c, which is equivalent (multiplying both sides by the positive denominator) to

  (a + b + c)³  ≥  4·∑_{sym} a²b  + 3abc.

**Step 3.  Reduction to Schur’s inequality.**

Expand the left‐hand side:

  (a + b + c)³ = a³ + b³ + c³  + 3(a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b)  + 6abc
               = a³ + b³ + c³  + 3·∑_{sym} a²b  + 6abc.

Thus the inequality

  (a + b + c)³  ≥  4·∑_{sym} a²b  + 3abc

becomes after subtracting the right side from both sides:

  [a³ + b³ + c³]  + 3·∑_{sym} a²b  + 6abc
  − [4·∑_{sym} a²b  + 3abc]
  =  a³ + b³ + c³  − ∑_{sym} a²b  + 3abc  ≥  0.

Rearranging, this is exactly

  a³ + b³ + c³  + 3abc  ≥  a(b² + c²)  +  b(c² + a²)  +  c(a² + b²),

which is the classical Schur’s inequality of degree 3.  Schur’s inequality is known to hold for all nonnegative a,b,c, with equality precisely when at least two of the variables are equal and the third is zero, or when a=b=c.

**Step 4.  Conclusion and optimality of C.**

Combining the above steps shows that for every nonnegative triple (a,b,c) with a+b+c>0,

  a⁄(4b²+bc+4c²) + b⁄(4c²+ca+4a²) + c⁄(4a²+ab+4b²)  ≥  1⁄(a + b + c).

Hence the inequality holds with C=1.  Moreover, equality occurs whenever Schur’s inequality is an equality—e.g.

  •  a=b=c>0, or
  •  (a,b,c) = (t,t,0) up to permutation,

in which case each step above is sharp.  Thus no larger constant than C=1 can work for all nonnegative a,b,c.

Therefore, the largest constant C for which (1) holds is

The answer is $C=1$
