## Problem
Let $x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$, such that $x y z \geq x y + y z + z x$. Consider the following expressions:
$$
x y z \quad () \quad 3(x+y+z)
$$
Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
Letting $\frac{1}{x}=a, \frac{1}{y}=b, \frac{1}{z}=c$, the initial condition $x y z \geq x y+y z+z x$ becomes
$$
\begin{equation*}
a+b+c \leq 1 \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

We need to show that
$$
\begin{equation*}
x y z \geq 3(x+y+z) \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 3(a b+b c+c a) \leq 1 \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Clearly
$$
\begin{equation*}
(a+b+c)^{2} \geq 3(a b+b c+c a) \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

Now from (1) and (3) we obtain (2). Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to determine the correct relation between x y z and 3(x + y + z), given that x, y, z are positive real numbers satisfying

  x y z  ≥ x y + y z + z x.    (1)

Our goal is to show that under condition (1), the following inequality holds:

  x y z  ≥ 3(x + y + z).    (2)

We will proceed by the same substitution as in the original solution, but with fuller justification of each step.

Step 1: Introduce new positive variables a, b, c by

  a = 1/x,
  b = 1/y,
  c = 1/z.

Since x, y, z > 0, each of a, b, c is also positive.

Step 2: Rewrite the given condition (1) in terms of a, b, c.

We have

  x y z  = 1/(a b c),
  x y    = 1/(a b),
  y z    = 1/(b c),
  z x    = 1/(c a).

Substituting into x y z ≥ x y + y z + z x gives

  1/(a b c)  ≥ 1/(a b) + 1/(b c) + 1/(c a).

Multiply both sides by the positive quantity a b c to clear denominators:

  1  ≥  c + a + b.

Reordering the sum yields

  a + b + c  ≤ 1.    (3)

This is the equivalent form of the original condition in the new variables.

Step 3: Rewrite the target inequality (2) in terms of a, b, c.

Starting from x y z ≥ 3(x + y + z), we similarly substitute:

  x y z     = 1/(a b c),
  x         = 1/a,   y = 1/b,   z = 1/c,
  x + y + z = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c.

Hence (2) becomes

  1/(a b c)  ≥ 3(1/a + 1/b + 1/c).

Multiply through by the positive a b c:

  1  ≥  3(b c + c a + a b).

Rewriting, we obtain the equivalent inequality

  3(a b + b c + c a)  ≤ 1.    (4)

Thus our task is reduced to proving (4) under the assumption (3).

Step 4: Relate a + b + c and a b + b c + c a via a standard symmetric inequality.

A well-known fact for any real numbers a, b, c is that

  (a + b + c)²  =  a² + b² + c²  + 2(a b + b c + c a)
               ≥  3(a b + b c + c a),

because a² + b² + c² ≥ a b + b c + c a (which itself follows from summing the nonnegative squares (a − b)² + (b − c)² + (c − a)² ≥ 0).  Hence

  (a + b + c)²  ≥ 3(a b + b c + c a).    (5)

Step 5: Combine (3) and (5) to derive (4).

From (3) we have a + b + c ≤ 1.  Squaring both sides (permitted since both sides are nonnegative) gives

  (a + b + c)²  ≤ 1²  = 1.    (6)

Comparing (5) and (6), we see that

  3(a b + b c + c a)  ≤ (a + b + c)²  ≤ 1.

In particular, 3(a b + b c + c a) ≤ 1, which is precisely inequality (4).

Step 6: Translate back to the original variables.

Since (4) is equivalent to x y z ≥ 3(x + y + z), we have established that whenever x y z ≥ x y + y z + z x holds, it follows that x y z ≥ 3(x + y + z).  Therefore, the correct relation between x y z and 3(x + y + z) is ≥.

Final Answer:

The answer is (B) ≥
