## Problem
Let $a, b, c, d$ be non-negative real numbers such that $a+b+c+d=4$. Find the smallest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
(1+3a)(1+3b)(1+3c)(1+3d) \leq C + 131abcd
$$

## Current Solution
Let us denote
$$
f(a, b, c, d)=(1+3 a)(1+3 b)(1+3 c)(1+3 d)-131 a b c d
$$

Without loss of generality we may assume that $a \geq b \geq c \geq d$.
We have
$$
\begin{align*}
& f(a, b, c, d)-f\left(\frac{a+c}{2}, b, \frac{a+c}{2}, d\right) \\
& \quad=9(1+3 b)(1+3 d)\left(a c-\frac{(a+c)^{2}}{4}\right)-131 b d\left(a c-\frac{(a+c)^{2}}{4}\right) \\
& \quad=\frac{(a-c)^{2}}{4}(131 b d-9(1+3 b)(1+3 d)) \tag{1}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that
$$
b+d \leq \frac{1}{2}(a+b+c+d)=2
$$
and clearly
$$
\begin{equation*}
b d \leq \frac{(b+d)^{2}}{4}=1 \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$
therefore
$$
\begin{aligned}
& 131 b d-9(1+3 b)(1+3 d) \\
& \quad=131 b d-9-27(b+d)-81 b d \\
& \quad=50 b d-27(b+d)-9=50 b d-27(b+d)-9 \stackrel{A \geq G}{\leq} 50 b d-54 \sqrt{b d} \\
& \quad \stackrel{(2)}{\leq} 50 b d-54 b d=-4 b d \leq 0 .
\end{aligned}
$$

By (1) and the last inequality we deduce that
$$
f(a, b, c, d)-f\left(\frac{a+c}{2}, b, \frac{a+c}{2}, d\right) \leq 0
$$
i.e.
$$
f(a, b, c, d) \leq f\left(\frac{a+c}{2}, b, \frac{a+c}{2}, d\right)
$$

According to the SMV theorem it follows that it's enough to prove that
$$
f(a, b, c, d) \leq 125
$$
when $a=b=c=t \geq d$, i.e.
$$
f(t, t, t, d) \leq 125, \quad \text { when } 3 t+d=4
$$

Clearly $3 t \leq 4$.
We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(t, t, t, d) \leq 125 \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad(1+3 t)^{3}(1+3(4-3 t))-131 t^{3}(4-3 t) \leq 125 \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 150 t^{4}-416 t^{3}+270 t^{2}+108 t-112 \leq 0 \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad(t-1)^{2}(3 t-4)(50 t+28) \leq 0, \text { which is true. }
\end{aligned}
$$

Equality occurs when $a = b = c = d = 1$ or $a = b = c = \frac{4}{3}, d = 0$ (up to permutation). In both cases, the left side equals $C + 131 abcd$, so the minimum value of $C$ for which the inequality always holds is $C = 125$.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 125$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 125$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that for all nonnegative real numbers a,b,c,d satisfying a+b+c+d=4, the product

    (1+3a)(1+3b)(1+3c)(1+3d)

is bounded above by C+131abcd, and to find the smallest such C.

**1. Reformulation via an auxiliary function.**  Set

    f(a,b,c,d)
      = (1+3a)(1+3b)(1+3c)(1+3d)
        − 131·a·b·c·d.

Then the desired inequality

    (1+3a)(1+3b)(1+3c)(1+3d) ≤ C + 131abcd

is equivalent to

    f(a,b,c,d) ≤ C

for all a,b,c,d≥0 with a+b+c+d=4.  Our goal is to show that the maximum of f under the constraint a+b+c+d=4 is 125, and hence C=125.

**2. A "smoothing" (equalizing) step.**  Notice that f is symmetric in its four arguments.  We claim that if two of the variables differ, say a and c, then replacing (a,c) by their average increases the sum a+c (thus keeping the total a+b+c+d=4 fixed) and does not decrease f.  Concretely, define

   A = (a+c)/2,
   C = (a+c)/2,
   B = b,
   D = d.

We compare f(a,b,c,d) with f(A,b,C,d).  A direct computation yields

    f(a,b,c,d) − f(A,b,C,d)
      = (1+3b)(1+3d)igl[(1+3a)(1+3c) − (1+3A)^2igr]
        − 131·b·d·(ac − A^2)

      = 9(1+3b)(1+3d)igl(ac − (a+c)^2/4igr)
        − 131·b·digl(ac − (a+c)^2/4igr)

      = [(ac − ((a+c)^2)/4)] · [9(1+3b)(1+3d) − 131·b·d]  .

Since (ac −((a+c)^2)/4) = −(a−c)^2/4 ≤ 0, it suffices to show

    9(1+3b)(1+3d) − 131·b·d ≥ 0
    ⇔ 131·b·d − 9(1+3b)(1+3d) ≤ 0.

Expand the latter:

    131bd − 9(1 +3b +3d +9bd)
      = 131bd − 9 −27(b+d) −81bd
      = 50bd −27(b+d) −9.

Next, by the arithmetic–geometric mean inequality,

    b+d ≥ 2√{bd},

so

    −27(b+d) ≤ −54√{bd}.

Hence

    50bd −27(b+d) −9 ≤ 50bd −54√{bd} −9.

But on [0,∞), the quadratic in √{bd}, namely

    50·(√{bd})^2 −54·√{bd} −9

achieves its maximum at the boundary of √{bd}∈[0,∞).  In fact, since bd≤((b+d)/2)^2 ≤1 (because b+d ≤½(a+b+c+d)=2), one sees

    √{bd} ≤1 ⇒ 50bd −54√{bd} −9 ≤ 50·1 −54·1 −9 = −13 <0.

Therefore 131bd −9(1+3b)(1+3d) ≤0, and so f(a,b,c,d) ≤ f(A,b,C,d).  In words, replacing (a,c) by their average cannot decrease f.  By symmetry, one can carry out the same averaging on any pair of variables.

**3. Reduction to the case of at most two distinct values.**  Repeatedly applying the above pairwise averaging argument shows that the maximum of f under the constraint a+b+c+d=4 occurs when at most two distinct values appear among {a,b,c,d}.  Since f is fully symmetric, we may assume without loss of generality that three of the variables are equal and the fourth possibly different.  Thus set

    a = b = c = t,   d = 4 − 3t,   where  t ≥ 0,  4−3t ≥ 0  ⇒ 0 ≤ t ≤ 4/3.

It remains to maximize

    f(t,t,t,4−3t)
      = (1+3t)^3 · (1 + 3(4−3t))  − 131·t^3·(4−3t)
      = (1+3t)^3(13−9t) − 131t^3(4−3t).

**4. Verifying the one–variable inequality.**  We claim

    (1+3t)^3(13−9t) − 131t^3(4−3t)  ≤ 125,

for all t∈[0,4/3].  Equivalently,

    (1+3t)^3(13−9t) − 131t^3(4−3t) − 125  ≤ 0.

Expand and simplify to obtain the quartic polynomial

    P(t) := 150t^4 −416t^3 +270t^2 +108t −112.

A factorization check shows

    P(t) = (t−1)^2 · (3t−4) · (50t+28).

On the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 4/3, we have
  • (t−1)^2 ≥ 0,
  • (50t+28)>0,
  • (3t−4) ≤ 3·(4/3)−4 = 0,

so P(t)≤0 throughout [0,4/3].  Thus f(t,t,t,4−3t) ≤ 125 in the entire domain.

**5. Conclusion and sharpness.**  We have shown f(a,b,c,d) ≤ 125 for all nonnegative a,b,c,d with a+b+c+d=4, and we have exhibited cases of equality:

    • a=b=c=d=1  ⇒ (1+3a)^4 = 4^4=256, abcd=1  ⇒ f=256−131=125.
    • a=b=c=4/3, d=0  ⇒ (1+4)^3(1+0)=5^3=125,  abcd=0  ⇒ f=125.

Hence the smallest constant for which

    (1+3a)(1+3b)(1+3c)(1+3d) ≤ C + 131abcd

holds under a+b+c+d=4 is

The answer is $C=125$
