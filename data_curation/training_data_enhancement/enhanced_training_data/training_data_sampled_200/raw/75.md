## Problem
Let $x, y, z$ be real numbers different from 1, such that $x y z = 1$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x, y, z$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\left(\frac{3-x}{1-x}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{3-y}{1-y}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{3-z}{1-z}\right)^{2} > C
$$

## Current Solution
Denote $A=\left(\frac{3-x}{1-x}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{3-y}{1-y}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{3-z}{1-z}\right)^{2}-7$.
We have
$$
A=\left(1+\frac{2}{1-x}\right)^{2}+\left(1+\frac{2}{1-y}\right)^{2}+\left(1+\frac{2}{1-z}\right)^{2}-7
$$

Let $\frac{1}{1-x}=a, \frac{1}{1-y}=b, \frac{1}{1-z}=c$.
Then $A=(1+2 a)^{2}+(1+2 b)^{2}+(1+2 c)^{2}-7$, i.e.
$$
\begin{equation*}
A=4 a^{2}+4 b^{2}+4 c^{2}+4 a+4 b+4 c-4 \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Furthermore, the condition $x y z=1$ is equivalent to $a b c=(a-1)(b-1)(c-1)$, i.e.
$$
\begin{equation*}
a+b+c-1=a b+b c+c a \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using (1) and (2) we get
$$
A=4 a^{2}+4 b^{2}+4 c^{2}+4(a b+b c+c a)=2\left((a+b)^{2}+(b+c)^{2}+(c+a)^{2}\right)
$$
i.e. $A \geq 0$.

Equality occurs if and only if $a=b=c=0$, which is impossible under the given constraints. Therefore, the minimum value of the original expression is strictly greater than $7$, and $C = 7$ is the largest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 7$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 7$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that for all real x,y,z≠1 satisfying xyz=1, the sum

    S = \bigl(\frac{3 - x}{1 - x}\bigr)^2 + \bigl(\frac{3 - y}{1 - y}\bigr)^2 + \bigl(\frac{3 - z}{1 - z}\bigr)^2

always exceeds 7, and that 7 is the best possible lower bound.  We follow the original approach but supply fuller justifications.

Step 1.  Introduce the auxiliary quantity A

    A = S - 7

so that proving S > 7 is equivalent to proving A > 0 for all admissible x,y,z.

Step 2.  Rewrite each summand in a more convenient form.  Observe that for any real t≠1,

    \frac{3 - t}{1 - t}
    = \frac{(1 - t) + 2}{1 - t}
    = 1 + \frac{2}{1 - t}.

Hence

    \bigl(\frac{3 - x}{1 - x}\bigr)^2 = \bigl(1 + \frac{2}{1 - x}\bigr)^2,

and similarly for the y- and z-terms.  Therefore

    A = \sum_{u\in\{x,y,z\}}\Bigl(1 + \frac{2}{1 - u}\Bigr)^2 \; - \; 7.

Step 3.  Introduce new variables a,b,c by

    a = \frac{1}{1 - x},
    b = \frac{1}{1 - y},
    c = \frac{1}{1 - z}.

Since x,y,z≠1, none of 1−x,1−y,1−z is zero, so a,b,c are well-defined real numbers.  In terms of these,

    1 + \frac{2}{1 - x} = 1 + 2a,

etc.  Thus

    A = (1 + 2a)^2 + (1 + 2b)^2 + (1 + 2c)^2 \; - 7.

Expanding gives

    A = [1 + 4a + 4a^2] + [1 + 4b + 4b^2] + [1 + 4c + 4c^2] - 7
      = 4(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 4(a + b + c) - 4.

Step 4.  Translate the constraint xyz = 1 into a relation among a,b,c.  From a=1/(1−x) we have x = 1 − 1/a, and similarly

    y = 1 - \frac{1}{b}, \quad z = 1 - \frac{1}{c}.

Hence

    xyz = \Bigl(1 - \frac1a\Bigr)\Bigl(1 - \frac1b\Bigr)\Bigl(1 - \frac1c\Bigr) = 1.

Expand the product on the left:

    (1 - 1/a)(1 - 1/b)(1 - 1/c)
    = 1 - (1/a + 1/b + 1/c) + (1/(ab) + 1/(bc) + 1/(ca)) - 1/(abc).

Setting this equal to 1 and rearranging yields

    1/a + 1/b + 1/c - (1/(ab) + 1/(bc) + 1/(ca)) + 1/(abc) = 0.

Multiply through by abc ≠ 0:

    bc + ca + ab - (c + a + b) + 1 = 0,

or equivalently

    (a + b + c) - 1 = ab + bc + ca.   (★)

Step 5.  Use relation (★) to simplify A.  From the expansion in Step 3,

    A = 4(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 4(a + b + c) - 4
      = 4(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 4[(a + b + c) - 1]
      = 4(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 4(ab + bc + ca)
      = 4\bigl[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + (ab + bc + ca)\bigr].

Step 6.  Recognize and estimate the symmetric quadratic form.  A standard identity is

    (a + b)^2 + (b + c)^2 + (c + a)^2
    = 2\bigl[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + (ab + bc + ca)\bigr].

Therefore

    A = 2\bigl[(a + b)^2 + (b + c)^2 + (c + a)^2\bigr].

Since each square (a+b)^2, (b+c)^2, (c+a)^2 is nonnegative, their sum is nonnegative, and hence

    A ≥ 0.

Step 7.  Show strict positivity.  If A = 0, then

    (a + b)^2 = (b + c)^2 = (c + a)^2 = 0

implying a + b = b + c = c + a = 0.  Adding the first two gives 2b + (a + c) = 0 ⇒ 2b = 0 ⇒ b = 0; similarly a = c = 0.  But a = 1/(1 - x) = 0 has no real solution for x (since 1/(1 - x) ≠ 0 for any real x), a contradiction.  Hence A cannot vanish, and in fact

    A > 0

for every admissible triple (x,y,z).  Consequently

    S = A + 7 > 7

always.

Step 8.  Conclusion on the best bound.  We have proved that S > 7 for all x,y,z≠1 with xyz=1, so C = 7 is a valid lower bound.  On the other hand, no larger constant than 7 can work, since making A arbitrarily small (though positive) shows S can approach 7 arbitrarily closely.  Therefore 7 is the largest such C.

Final Answer:

The answer is $C=7$
