## Problem
Let $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ such that $a + 2b + 3c \geq 20$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
S = a + b + c + \frac{3}{a} + \frac{9}{2b} + \frac{4}{c} \geq C
$$

## Current Solution
$S=13$ at the point $a=2, b=3, c=4$.
Using $A M \geq G M$ we get
$$
a+\frac{4}{a} \geq 2 \sqrt{a \cdot \frac{4}{a}}=4, \quad b+\frac{9}{b} \geq 2 \sqrt{b \cdot \frac{9}{b}}=6, \quad c+\frac{16}{c} \geq 2 \sqrt{c \cdot \frac{16}{c}}=8
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{3}{4}\left(a+\frac{4}{a}\right) \geq 3, \quad \frac{1}{2}\left(b+\frac{9}{b}\right) \geq 3 \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{1}{4}\left(c+\frac{16}{c}\right) \geq 2
$$

Adding the last three inequalities we have
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{3}{4} a+\frac{1}{2} b+\frac{1}{4} c+\frac{3}{a}+\frac{9}{2 b}+\frac{4}{c} \geq 8 \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using $a+2 b+3 c \geq 20$ we obtain
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{4} a+\frac{1}{2} b+\frac{3}{4} c \geq 5 \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Finally, after adding (1) and (2) we get
$$
a+b+c+\frac{3}{a}+\frac{9}{2 b}+\frac{4}{c} \geq 13
$$
as desired.

Equality holds when $a=2$, $b=3$, $c=4$, since at this point $a+2b+3c=2+6+12=20$ and $S=2+3+4+\frac{3}{2}+\frac{9}{6}+1=9+1.5+1.5+1=13$. This gives the minimum value of $S$, so $C=13$ is the largest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 13$. 

## Expected Answer
$C = 13$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to find the largest constant C such that for all positive real numbers a, b, c satisfying
a + 2b + 3c \ge 20,

we have

  S = a + b + c + \frac{3}{a} + \frac{9}{2b} + \frac{4}{c} \;\ge\; C.

Our strategy is to apply the AM–GM inequality in carefully chosen groupings so that when we combine those inequalities with the given constraint, the left‐hand side telescopes exactly into S, and the right‐hand side yields a numerical bound.  We then check that equality is attained, showing that our bound is best possible.

Step 1.  Apply the standard AM–GM inequality “x + y \ge 2\sqrt{xy}” to each of the three pairs:

  (i)  Let x = a,  y = 4/a.  Then

     a + \frac{4}{a}  \;\ge\; 2\sqrt{a \cdot \frac{4}{a}}  = 2\sqrt{4}  = 4.

  (ii) Let x = b,  y = 9/b.  Then

     b + \frac{9}{b}  \;\ge\; 2\sqrt{b \cdot \frac{9}{b}}  = 2\sqrt{9}  = 6.

  (iii) Let x = c,  y = 16/c.  Then

     c + \frac{16}{c} \;\ge\; 2\sqrt{c \cdot \frac{16}{c}} = 2\sqrt{16} = 8.

Step 2.  Introduce weights so that the sums of these three inequalities reproduce the reciprocal‐term part of S and part of its linear part.  Specifically, multiply the three displayed inequalities by 3/4, 1/2, and 1/4, respectively.  This gives:

  (i')   \frac{3}{4}\,\Bigl(a + \frac{4}{a}\Bigr) \ge \frac{3}{4}\cdot4 = 3,  \quad  i.e.\;  \frac{3}{4}a + \frac{3}{a} \ge 3,

  (ii')  \frac{1}{2}\,\Bigl(b + \frac{9}{b}\Bigr) \ge \frac{1}{2}\cdot6 = 3,  \quad  i.e.\;  \frac{1}{2}b + \frac{9}{2b} \ge 3,

  (iii') \frac{1}{4}\,\Bigl(c + \frac{16}{c}\Bigr) \ge \frac{1}{4}\cdot8 = 2,  \quad  i.e.\;  \frac{1}{4}c + \frac{4}{c} \ge 2.

Adding (i'), (ii'), (iii') side by side yields

  \frac{3}{4}a + \frac{1}{2}b + \frac{1}{4}c
  \;+
  \Bigl(\frac{3}{a} + \frac{9}{2b} + \frac{4}{c}\Bigr)
  \;
  \ge\; 3 + 3 + 2 = 8.

Hence we obtain the intermediate bound

  (1)\quad  \frac{3}{4}a + \frac{1}{2}b + \frac{1}{4}c + \frac{3}{a} + \frac{9}{2b} + \frac{4}{c} \ge 8.

Step 3.  Use the given linear constraint a + 2b + 3c \ge 20 to produce the complementary combination of a, b, c.  Divide both sides of

  a + 2b + 3c \ge 20

by 4.  This yields

  (2)\quad  \frac{1}{4}a + \frac{1}{2}b + \frac{3}{4}c \ge 5.

Step 4.  Add inequalities (1) and (2) term‐by‐term.  On the left‐hand side the coefficients of a, b, c sum to 1,

  \frac{3}{4}a + \frac{1}{4}a = a,
  \quad
  \frac{1}{2}b + \frac{1}{2}b = b,
  \quad
  \frac{1}{4}c + \frac{3}{4}c = c,

and the reciprocal terms remain unchanged.  Thus

  a + b + c + \frac{3}{a} + \frac{9}{2b} + \frac{4}{c}
  \;\ge\; 8 + 5 = 13.

By definition this shows S \ge 13 for all admissible a,b,c.  Hence the largest possible constant C is at most 13.

Step 5.  Verification of equality.  To see that C = 13 is attained, observe that equality in the AM–GM steps

  a + \frac{4}{a} = 4,\quad b + \frac{9}{b} = 6,\quad c + \frac{16}{c} = 8

occurs precisely when a = 4/a, b = 9/b, c = 16/c, i.e. a = 2, b = 3, c = 4.  At the same time the constraint a + 2b + 3c \ge 20 is tight:

  2 + 2\cdot3 + 3\cdot4 = 2 + 6 + 12 = 20.

Hence at (a,b,c) = (2,3,4) we have S = 2 + 3 + 4 + 3/2 + 9/6 + 4/4 = 9 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1 = 13, realizing the bound.  This shows that 13 cannot be improved.

Therefore, the largest constant C for which the inequality always holds is

The answer is $C=13$
