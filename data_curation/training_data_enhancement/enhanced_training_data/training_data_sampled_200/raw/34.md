## Problem
Let $x, y, z, t \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. Find the smallest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all positive $x, y, z, t$:
$$
x^{4}+y^{4}+z^{4}+t^{4}+C x y z t \geq x^{2} y^{2}+y^{2} z^{2}+z^{2} t^{2}+t^{2} x^{2}+x^{2} z^{2}+y^{2} t^{2}
$$

## Current Solution
Clearly, it is enough to prove the inequality if $x y z t=1$ and so the problem becomes

If $a, b, c, d$ have product 1 , then $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}+2 \geq a b+b c+c d+d a+a c+b d$. Let $d$ the minimum among $a, b, c, d$ and let $m=\sqrt[3]{a b c}$. We will prove that
$a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}+2-(a b+b c+c d+d a+a c+b d) \geq d^{2}+3 m^{2}+2-\left(3 m^{2}+3 m d\right)$, which is in fact

$$
a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-a b-b c-c a \geq d(a+b+c-3 \sqrt[3]{a b c})
$$

Because $d \leq \sqrt[3]{a b c}$, proving this first inequality comes down to the inequality

$$
a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-a b-b c-c a \geq \sqrt[3]{a b c}(a+b+c-3 \sqrt[3]{a b c})
$$

Take $u=\frac{a}{\sqrt[3]{a b c}}, v=\frac{b}{\sqrt[3]{a b c}}, w=\frac{c}{\sqrt[3]{a b c}}$. Using problem 74 , we find that

$$
u^{2}+v^{2}+w^{2}+3 \geq u+v+w+u v+v w+w u
$$

which is exactly $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-a b-b c-c a \geq \sqrt[3]{a b c}(a+b+c-3 \sqrt[3]{a b c})$. Thus, it remains to prove that $d^{2}+2 \geq 3 m d \Leftrightarrow d^{2}+2 \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{d^{2}}$, which is clear.

Equality holds when $x = y = z = t = 1$, since then both sides of the original inequality are equal: $4 + 2 \cdot 1 = 6$ and $6$. This gives the minimum value of $C$, so $C = 2$ is the smallest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 2$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 2$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to find the smallest constant C such that for all positive real x,y,z,t one has

  x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + t^4 + C·x y z t  ≥  x^2y^2 + y^2z^2 + z^2t^2 + t^2x^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2t^2.

We shall show C=2 is minimal, following exactly the original strategy but with fuller details.  

1.  Homogenization and normalization.  
Since the inequality is homogeneous of degree 4, we may impose the normalization

  x y z t = 1.

Set (a,b,c,d) = (x,y,z,t), so that a,b,c,d>0 and a b c d=1.  We must prove

  a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 + C·a b c d  ≥  sum of all six pairwise products of squares,

which under a b c d=1 reads

  a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 + C  ≥  a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2d^2 + d^2a^2 + a^2c^2 + b^2d^2.

Equivalently, bringing the right–hand side to the left and using a b c d=1 we set C=2 and aim to show

  Δ := (a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4) + 2  –  (a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2d^2 + d^2a^2 + a^2c^2 + b^2d^2)  ≥ 0.

2.  Rewriting Δ in quadratic form.  
Observe that for any real X,Y one has X^4+Y^4 – 2X^2Y^2 = (X^2 – Y^2)^2 ≥0.  In particular,

  a^4 + b^4 – 2a^2b^2  = (a^2 – b^2)^2,
  b^4 + c^4 – 2b^2c^2  = (b^2 – c^2)^2,
  c^4 + d^4 – 2c^2d^2  = (c^2 – d^2)^2,
  d^4 + a^4 – 2d^2a^2  = (d^2 – a^2)^2.

Summing these four identities gives

  2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4)  – 2(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2d^2 + d^2a^2)
  =  (a^2–b^2)^2 + (b^2–c^2)^2 + (c^2–d^2)^2 + (d^2–a^2)^2  ≥ 0.

Hence

  a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4  ≥  a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2d^2 + d^2a^2.

Substituting into Δ yields

  Δ  ≥  [a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2d^2 + d^2a^2]  + 2  –  [a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2d^2 + d^2a^2 + a^2c^2 + b^2d^2]
     = 2  –  (a^2c^2 + b^2d^2).

But this crude bound does not suffice alone; instead we reorganize more symmetrically as follows.

3.  Symmetric decomposition via the minimal variable.  
Let d = min{a,b,c,d}.  Define m := (a b c)^{1/3}.  Because a b c d =1, we have a b c =1/d.  Also since d≤a,b,c, one gets

  a b c  ≥ d^3  ⇒  1/d ≥ d^3  ⇒  d^4 ≤1  ⇒  d ≤1,

and therefore

  m = (a b c)^{1/3} = (1/d)^{1/3} ≥1  ⇒  m ≥ d.

We now split Δ as

  Δ  =  (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 2)  –  (ab + bc + cd + da + ac + bd)
      =  [a^2 + b^2 + c^2  –  (ab+bc+ca)]  +  [d^2 + 2  –  d(a+b+c)]  +  (–bd – cd + bd + cd)
      =  [T] + [U],

where we have grouped terms so that

  T := (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)  –  (ab + bc + ca),
  U := d^2 + 2  –  d(a + b + c).

We will show T ≥ d·(a + b + c – 3m) and U ≥ d^2 +2 –3md, then combine these.

4.  Lower bound for T.  
Since d ≤ m, it holds that

  T  =  (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)  –  (ab + bc + ca)
     ≥  m·(a + b + c – 3m).

To see this rigorously, set u := a/m, v := b/m, w := c/m.  Then u v w = (abc)/m^3 =1, and T = m^2[(u^2+v^2+w^2) – (uv+vw+wu)].  Meanwhile,

  m·(a + b + c – 3m)  =  m^2(u + v + w – 3).

Hence the desired inequality T ≥ m·(a+b+c–3m) is equivalent to

  (u^2+v^2+w^2) – (uv+vw+wu)  ≥  (u+v+w–3).

Rearrange to

  u^2+v^2+w^2+3  ≥  u+v+w + uv+vw+wu,

which is exactly the statement of the known symmetric inequality (Problem 74).  This completes the proof that

  T  ≥  m·(a + b + c – 3m)  ≥  d·(a + b + c – 3m).

5.  Lower bound for U.  
We rewrite

  U  =  d^2 + 2  –  d(a + b + c)
     =  [d^2 + 2]  – 3·(m d)  –  d[(a+b+c) –3m].

Since m≥d and by AM–GM on a,b,c we know (a+b+c)/3 ≥ (abc)^{1/3} = m ⇒ (a+b+c) –3m ≥0, it follows that

  U  ≥  (d^2 + 2)  – 3m d.

Moreover, from m = (1/d)^{1/3} we get m d = d^{2/3}.  Hence

  d^2 + 2  – 3m d  =  d^2 + 1 + 1  – 3d^{2/3}  ≥  3·(d^2·1·1)^{1/3}  – 3d^{2/3}  = 0

by the arithmetic–geometric mean inequality on the three terms d^2,1,1.

6.  Conclusion.  
Combining the two estimates:

  Δ  = T + U  ≥  d·(a+b+c–3m)  +  [ (d^2+2) –3m d ]  ≥  0.

Thus for C=2 the original inequality holds for all positive x,y,z,t.  On the other hand, testing x=y=z=t=1 shows equality at C=2, proving minimality.

Therefore, the answer is $C=2$.
