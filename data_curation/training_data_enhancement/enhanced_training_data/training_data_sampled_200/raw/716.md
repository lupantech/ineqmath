## Problem
Let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ such that $x + y = 2$. Consider the following inequality:
$$
x^{3} y^{3}\left(x^{3}+y^{3}\right) \quad () \quad 2 .
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
Since $A M \geq G M$ we have $\sqrt{x y} \leq \frac{x+y}{2}=1$, i.e. $x y \leq 1$.
Hence $0 \leq x y \leq 1$.
Furthermore
$$
\begin{aligned}
x^{3} y^{3}\left(x^{3}+y^{3}\right) & =(x y)^{3}(x+y)\left(x^{2}-x y+y^{2}\right)=2(x y)^{3}\left((x+y)^{2}-3 x y\right) \\
& =2(x y)^{3}(4-3 x y)
\end{aligned}
$$

It's enough to show that
$$
(x y)^{3}(4-3 x y) \leq 1
$$

Let $x y=z$ then $0 \leq z \leq 1$ and clearly $4-3 z>0$.

Then using $A M \geq G M$ we obtain
$$
z^{3}(4-3 z)=z \cdot z \cdot z(4-3 z) \leq\left(\frac{z+z+z+4-3 z}{4}\right)^{4}=1
$$
as required.
Equality occurs if and only if $z=4-3 z$, i.e. $z=1$, i.e. $x=y=1$. Therefore, the answer is (A) $\leq$.

## Expected Answer
(A) $\leq$

## Enhanced Solution
We start with two positive real numbers x,y satisfying

  (1)  x+y = 2.  

We wish to determine the correct relation among “<, >, =, ≤, ≥” between the expression

  E = x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3)

and the constant 2.  In other words, we want to decide whether

  x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3)  ()  2

holds, and find the correct inequality symbol “()”.

Step 1.  Bound on the product x y using the AM–GM inequality.

Since x,y>0, the Arithmetic Mean–Geometric Mean (AM–GM) inequality states

  (x + y)/2  ≥  sqrt(xy),

with equality if and only if x=y.  But x+y=2 by (1), so

  2/2  ≥  sqrt(xy)   ⇒   1 ≥  sqrt(xy)   ⇒   (sqrt(xy))^2 = x y  ≤ 1.

Hence

  0 < x y ≤ 1.

We introduce the notation

  z = x y,

so that 0 < z ≤ 1.  We will re-express E in terms of z.

---

Step 2.  Rewrite E = x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3) in terms of z and x+y.

First observe that

  x^3 y^3 = (x y)^3 = z^3.

Also, the sum of cubes factorization gives

  x^3 + y^3  =  (x + y)(x^2 - x y + y^2).

Since x+y=2, we get

  x^3 + y^3  =  2·(x^2 - x y + y^2).

Next, note that

  x^2 - x y + y^2  =  (x+y)^2 - 3 x y  =  2^2 - 3z  =  4 - 3z.

Putting these together,

  E = x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3)
    = z^3 · [2·(4 - 3z)]
    = 2 · z^3 · (4 - 3z).

Thus the original inequality E () 2 becomes

  2 · z^3 (4 - 3z)  ()  2.

Because 2>0, we can divide both sides by 2 and reduce the problem to showing

  z^3 (4 - 3z)  ()  1,

with 0 < z ≤ 1.

---

Step 3.  Prove the reduced inequality z^3(4−3z) ≤ 1 by AM–GM.

We are to show

  z^3 (4 - 3z)  ≤  1,

for all z in (0,1].  Observe that 4−3z > 0 on (0,1], so the product is well-defined and nonnegative.

Apply the AM–GM inequality to the four nonnegative numbers

  z,  z,  z,  (4 − 3z).

Their arithmetic mean is

  (z + z + z + (4−3z)) / 4  =  (3z + 4 − 3z)/4  =  4/4  = 1.

By AM–GM,

  (z·z·z·(4−3z))^(1/4)  ≤  (z+z+z+4−3z)/4  = 1.

Raising both sides to the fourth power yields

  z^3 · (4−3z)  ≤  1^4  = 1.

Hence the reduced inequality holds, and thus

  E = x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3)  = 2·[z^3(4−3z)]  ≤  2·1  = 2.

We conclude that for all x,y>0 with x+y=2,

  x^3 y^3 (x^3 + y^3)  ≤  2.

---

Step 4.  Equality case.

The AM–GM step becomes an equality precisely when all the four numbers

  z, z, z, 4−3z

are equal.  Setting z = 4−3z gives

  4z = 4   ⇒   z = 1.

Since z = x y = 1 and x + y = 2, the only possibility (for positive x,y) is x=y=1.  Substituting x=y=1 indeed gives E = 1^3·1^3·(1^3+1^3)=2, so equality occurs.

The answer is (A) ≤
