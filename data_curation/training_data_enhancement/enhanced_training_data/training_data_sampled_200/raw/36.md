## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a+b+c=1$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\left(a^{a}+b^{a}+c^{a}\right)\left(a^{b}+b^{b}+c^{b}\right)\left(a^{c}+b^{c}+c^{c}\right) \geq C(\sqrt[3]{a}+\sqrt[3]{b}+\sqrt[3]{c})^{3}
$$

## Current Solution
By Hölder's inequality we obtain
$$
\left(a^{a}+b^{a}+c^{a}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}\left(a^{b}+b^{b}+c^{b}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}\left(a^{c}+b^{c}+c^{c}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \geq a^{\frac{a+b+c}{3}}+b^{\frac{a+b+c}{3}}+c^{\frac{a+b+c}{3}}
$$

Since $a+b+c=1$, the conclusion follows.

Equality holds when $a = b = c = \frac{1}{3}$, in which case both sides of the inequality are equal. This gives the minimum value of the left side, so $C = 1$ is the largest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 1$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 1$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Detailed Solution:

We wish to show that for all positive real numbers a, b, c with a + b + c = 1,

   (a^a + b^a + c^a)
   (a^b + b^b + c^b)
   (a^c + b^c + c^c)
≥ C \bigl( a^{1/3} + b^{1/3} + c^{1/3} \bigr)^3,

and to determine the largest possible constant C.

Step 1.  Setting up Hölder’s Inequality.

We recall the following form of Hölder’s inequality for three nonnegative sequences \{x_j\}, \{y_j\}, \{z_j\}:

   (∑_{j=1}^n x_j)^{1/3}
   (∑_{j=1}^n y_j)^{1/3}
   (∑_{j=1}^n z_j)^{1/3}
≥ ∑_{j=1}^n (x_j)^{1/3}(y_j)^{1/3}(z_j)^{1/3}.

We apply this with n = 3 and the index j running over the three values corresponding to the variables a, b, c.  Define

   x_1 = a^a,
   x_2 = b^a,
   x_3 = c^a,

   y_1 = a^b,
   y_2 = b^b,
   y_3 = c^b,

   z_1 = a^c,
   z_2 = b^c,
   z_3 = c^c.

By construction, each sum ∑ x_j = a^a + b^a + c^a, and similarly for ∑ y_j, ∑ z_j.

Step 2.  Computing the right‐hand side inside the sum.

For each j ∈ {1,2,3}, we have

   (x_j)^{1/3}(y_j)^{1/3}(z_j)^{1/3}
 = (a_j^a)^{1/3} · (a_j^b)^{1/3} · (a_j^c)^{1/3}
 = a_j^{(a + b + c)/3},

where we write a_1 = a, a_2 = b, a_3 = c.  Since a + b + c = 1 by hypothesis, this exponent becomes 1/3, so

   (x_j)^{1/3}(y_j)^{1/3}(z_j)^{1/3} = a_j^{1/3}.

Hence the sum on the right of Hölder is

   ∑_{j=1}^3 (x_j)^{1/3}(y_j)^{1/3}(z_j)^{1/3}
 = a^{1/3} + b^{1/3} + c^{1/3}.

Step 3.  Applying Hölder and simplifying.

By Hölder,

   (a^a + b^a + c^a)^{1/3}
   (a^b + b^b + c^b)^{1/3}
   (a^c + b^c + c^c)^{1/3}
 ≥ a^{1/3} + b^{1/3} + c^{1/3}.

Raising both sides to the third power (which preserves the inequality since all expressions are positive) gives

   (a^a + b^a + c^a)
   (a^b + b^b + c^b)
   (a^c + b^c + c^c)
 ≥ \bigl(a^{1/3} + b^{1/3} + c^{1/3}\bigr)^3.

Thus the inequality holds with C = 1.

Step 4.  Verifying sharpness of C = 1.

Equality in Hölder’s inequality occurs precisely when the three sequences \{x_j\}, \{y_j\}, \{z_j\} are proportional term‐by‐term.  Here that condition reduces to

   a^a : a^b : a^c  =  b^a : b^b : b^c  =  c^a : c^b : c^c.

One checks that this can happen only when a = b = c.  Under the constraint a + b + c = 1, this forces a = b = c = 1/3.  Substituting a = b = c = 1/3 into both sides of the original inequality shows they coincide, confirming that C cannot be taken larger than 1.

Conclusion.  The largest constant C for which the given inequality holds for all positive a, b, c summing to 1 is

The answer is $C = 1$
