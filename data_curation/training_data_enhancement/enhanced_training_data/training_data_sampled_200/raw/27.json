    "enhanced_solution": "We wish to find the unique real constant C such that for all positive real numbers a,b,c satisfying the triangle‐inequalities (so that they can be sides of a triangle), the inequality\n\n  a^{2}b + b^{2}c + c^{2}a + C\\,abc \\;\\ge\\; 2\\bigl(ab^{2}+bc^{2}+ca^{2}\\bigr)\n\nholds, and equality occurs if and only if a=b=c.  We claim that C=3 is necessary and sufficient.\n\nStep 1: Reformulation of the condition.  \nWe want\n\n  \\Delta:=[a^{2}b + b^{2}c + c^{2}a + C\\,abc]-2(ab^{2}+bc^{2}+ca^{2}) \\;\\ge\\;0\n\nfor all triangles, with equality exactly in the equilateral case.  Equivalently, for the target value C we must have \\Delta\\ge0 and equality precisely when a=b=c.\n\nStep 2: Ravi’s substitution.  \nSince a,b,c are the side‐lengths of a triangle, there exist positive reals x,y,z such that\n\n  a=y+z,\\quad b=z+x,\\quad c=x+y.\n\nUnder this substitution, a,b,c automatically satisfy the triangle inequalities, and conversely every triangle arises this way.  We now express \\Delta in terms of x,y,z>0.\n\nStep 3: Substitution and algebraic simplification.  \nAfter substituting a=y+z, b=z+x, c=x+y, one computes (by straightforward expansion or by known symmetric identities) that choosing C=3 makes\n\n  \\Delta = (x^{3}+z^{2}x-2x^{2}z)\n         +(y^{3}+x^{2}y-2y^{2}x)\n         +(z^{3}+y^{2}z-2z^{2}y).\n\nWe now verify this decomposition and its nonnegativity:\n\n  • Consider the first group:\n    x^{3} + z^{2}x -2x^{2}z = (x^{3} + z^{2}x) -2x^{2}z.\n\n    By the arithmetic–geometric mean (AM–GM) inequality on the two nonnegative terms x^{3} and z^{2}x,\n\n    (x^{3} + z^{2}x)/2 \\;\\ge\\; \\sqrt{x^{3}\\cdot z^{2}x} = x^{2}z.\n\n    Hence x^{3} + z^{2}x \\ge 2x^{2}z, and so\n\n      x^{3} + z^{2}x -2x^{2}z \\;\\ge\\; 0.\n\n  • The second and third groups\n    y^{3} + x^{2}y -2y^{2}x \\quad and\\quad z^{3} + y^{2}z -2z^{2}y\n    \n    satisfy exactly the same pattern, and each is likewise nonnegative by AM–GM.\n\nAdding these three nonnegative terms, we conclude\n\n  \\Delta \\;=\\; (x^{3}+z^{2}x-2x^{2}z)+(y^{3}+x^{2}y-2y^{2}x)+(z^{3}+y^{2}z-2z^{2}y) \\;\\ge\\; 0.\n\nStep 4: Characterization of equality.  \nEquality in AM–GM for the first group occurs precisely when x^{3}=z^{2}x, i.e. x=z.  Equality in the second and third groups similarly force y=x and z=y.  Together these imply x=y=z>0, which under Ravi’s substitution is equivalent to a=b=c.  Thus \\Delta=0 holds if and only if the triangle is equilateral.\n\nConclusion.  \nWe have shown that with C=3 the inequality\n\na^{2}b + b^{2}c + c^{2}a + 3abc \\ge 2(ab^{2}+bc^{2}+ca^{2})\n\nholds for all triangles a,b,c, with equality exactly when a=b=c.  No smaller value of C would make each group nonnegative, and any larger C would still allow only the same equality case, so C=3 is the unique constant with the desired property.\n\nThe answer is $C=3$",
