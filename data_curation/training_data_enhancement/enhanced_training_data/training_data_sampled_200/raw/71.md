## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths of a given triangle. Find the minimal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the triangle inequality:
$$
a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2} < C(a b+b c+c a)
$$

## Current Solution
Let $a=x+y, b=y+z, c=z+x, x, y, z>0$.
Then we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
& (x+y)^{2}+(y+z)^{2}+(z+x)^{2} \\
& \quad<2((x+y)(y+z)+(y+z)(z+x)+(z+x)(x+y))
\end{aligned}
$$
or
$$
xy+yz+zx>0
$$
which is clearly true.

Equality is approached as $x, y, z \to 0$ (i.e., when the triangle becomes degenerate), but never actually achieved for positive $x, y, z$. Thus, $C = 2$ is the minimal constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 2$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 2$

## Enhanced Solution
We want to show that for any triangle with side‐lengths a,b,c, the inequality
  a² + b² + c² < C(ab + bc + ca)
holds, and to determine the smallest such C.  

1.  Ravi substitution (enforcing the triangle inequalities):  
   Since a,b,c are sides of a triangle, we can write  
     a = x + y,   b = y + z,   c = z + x,   
   with x,y,z > 0.  

2.  Express both sides of the desired inequality in terms of x,y,z.  
   •  Left‐hand side:
      a² + b² + c²  
      = (x+y)² + (y+z)² + (z+x)²  
      = [x² + 2xy + y²] + [y² + 2yz + z²] + [z² + 2zx + x²]  
      = 2(x² + y² + z²) + 2(xy + yz + zx).

   •  Right‐hand side for C=2:  
      2(ab + bc + ca)  
      = 2[(x+y)(y+z) + (y+z)(z+x) + (z+x)(x+y)].

3.  Expand the sum of pairwise products:  
   (x+y)(y+z) = x y + x z + y² + y z,
   (y+z)(z+x) = y z + y x + z² + z x,
   (z+x)(x+y) = z x + z y + x² + x y.
   Summing these three gives
     (x+y)(y+z)+(y+z)(z+x)+(z+x)(x+y)
     = (x² + y² + z²) + 3(xy + yz + zx).

   Hence
     2(ab + bc + ca)
     = 2[x² + y² + z² + 3(xy + yz + zx)]
     = 2(x² + y² + z²) + 6(xy + yz + zx).

4.  Compare RHS and LHS for C = 2:  
   2(ab + bc + ca) − [a² + b² + c²]
   = [2(x² + y² + z²) + 6(xy + yz + zx)]
     − [2(x² + y² + z²) + 2(xy + yz + zx)]
   = 4(xy + yz + zx).

   Since x,y,z > 0, we have xy + yz + zx > 0, so  
     2(ab + bc + ca) > a² + b² + c².  
   This establishes the inequality with C = 2, and it is strict for every nondegenerate triangle.

5.  Sharpness of C = 2:  
   As the triangle approaches degeneracy (for example, let y,z → 0 with x fixed),  
   one side approaches the sum of the other two, and the ratio
     (a² + b² + c²)/(ab + bc + ca)
   tends to 2.  Therefore no smaller constant C < 2 can work for all triangles.

Conclusion:  The smallest constant C for which  
  a² + b² + c² < C(ab + bc + ca)  
holds in every (nondegenerate) triangle is

The answer is $C=2$
