## Problem
Let $a, b, c, d, e$ be positive real numbers such that $a b c d e=1$. Consider the following inequality:
$$
\frac{a+a b c}{1+a b+a b c d}+\frac{b+b c d}{1+b c+b c d e}+\frac{c+c d e}{1+c d+c d e a}+\frac{d+d e a}{1+d e+d e a b}+\frac{e+e a b}{1+e a+e a b c} \quad () \quad \frac{10}{3} .
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
We consider the standard substitution

$$
a=\frac{x}{y}, b=\frac{y}{z}, c=\frac{z}{t}, d=\frac{t}{u}, e=\frac{u}{x}
$$

with $x, y, z, t, u>0$. It is clear that

$$
\frac{a+a b c}{1+a b+a b c d}=\frac{\frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{t}}{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{z}+\frac{1}{u}}
$$

Writing the other relations as well, and denoting $\frac{1}{x}=a_{1}, \frac{1}{y}=a_{2}, \frac{1}{z}=a_{3}, \frac{1}{t}=a_{4}, \frac{1}{u}=$ $a_{5}$, we have to prove that if $a_{i}>0$, then

$$
\sum \frac{a_{2}+a_{4}}{a_{1}+a_{3}+a_{5}} \geq \frac{1}{3}
$$

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we minor the left-hand side with

$$
\frac{4 S^{2}}{2 S^{2}-\left(a_{2}+a_{4}\right)^{2}-\left(a_{1}+a_{4}\right)^{2}-\left(a_{3}+a_{5}\right)^{2}-\left(a_{2}+a_{5}\right)^{2}-\left(a_{1}+a_{3}\right)^{2}}
$$

where $S=\sum_{i=1}^{5} a_{i}$. By applying the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality again for the denominator of the fraction, we obtain the conclusion. Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that for positive reals a,b,c,d,e satisfying abcde=1, the cyclic sum

  S = (a + a b c)/(1 + a b + a b c d)
    + (b + b c d)/(1 + b c + b c d e)
    + (c + c d e)/(1 + c d + c d e a)
    + (d + d e a)/(1 + d e + d e a b)
    + (e + e a b)/(1 + e a + e a b c)

satisfies S ≥ 10/3.

We carry out the proof in the following steps, preserving the original substitution and method but adding full detail and justification.

1.  Substitution to enforce the product condition.
    Since a,b,c,d,e>0 and abcde=1, introduce new positive variables x,y,z,t,u by
       a = x/y,
       b = y/z,
       c = z/t,
       d = t/u,
       e = u/x.
    Then indeed
       a·b·c·d·e = (x/y)(y/z)(z/t)(t/u)(u/x) = 1,
    so this parametrization is valid and bijective on the positive reals with product one.

2.  Rewriting each term over common denominators.
    For the first term,
      a b = x/z,
      a b c = x/t,
      a b c d = x/u,
    hence
      a + a b c = x/y + x/t,
      1 + a b + a b c d = 1 + x/z + x/u.
    Dividing numerator and denominator by x gives
      (a + a b c)/(1 + a b + a b c d)
      = (1/y + 1/t)/(1/x + 1/z + 1/u).
    Analogous cyclic computations yield the other four terms in the same form.

3.  Introduction of reciprocals a_i.
    Set
      a_1 = 1/x,
      a_2 = 1/y,
      a_3 = 1/z,
      a_4 = 1/t,
      a_5 = 1/u.
    All a_i are positive.  Then the five summands become
      S_1 = (a_2 + a_4)/(a_1 + a_3 + a_5),
      S_2 = (a_3 + a_5)/(a_2 + a_4 + a_1),
      S_3 = (a_4 + a_1)/(a_3 + a_5 + a_2),
      S_4 = (a_5 + a_2)/(a_4 + a_1 + a_3),
      S_5 = (a_1 + a_3)/(a_5 + a_2 + a_4).
    Hence the original inequality is equivalent to
      S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4 + S_5  ≥  10/3.

4.  Notation for sums.
    Let
      S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5,
    and for each i (indices mod 5) define
      A_i = a_{i+1} + a_{i+3},
      B_i = a_i + a_{i+2} + a_{i+4}.
    Then S_i = A_i/B_i, and we must prove
      ∑_{i=1}^5 (A_i/B_i)  ≥  10/3.

5.  First application of Cauchy–Schwarz (Titu’s lemma).
    Since all A_i,B_i>0, we write
      A_i/B_i = A_i^2/(A_i B_i).
    By Cauchy–Schwarz,
      ∑_{i=1}^5 A_i^2/(A_i B_i)
      ≥ (∑_{i=1}^5 A_i)^2  /  ∑_{i=1}^5 (A_i B_i).
    Note that
      ∑_{i=1}^5 A_i  =  2S
    because each a_j appears exactly twice among the numerators A_i.
    Therefore
      ∑ S_i  ≥  (2S)^2  /  ∑_{i=1}^5 (A_i B_i)
               =  4S^2 / ∑_{i=1}^5 (A_i B_i).

6.  Computation of ∑ A_i B_i in terms of S and the A_i.
    A direct (though somewhat lengthy) expansion shows the identity
      ∑_{i=1}^5 (A_i B_i)  =  2S^2  –  ∑_{i=1}^5 A_i^2.
    One can check this by expanding each product (a_{i+1}+a_{i+3})(a_i+a_{i+2}+a_{i+4}) and grouping like terms;
    the cross‐terms cancel appropriately and the above compact formula results.  Hence
      ∑ S_i  ≥  4S^2  /  [2S^2 – ∑_{i=1}^5 A_i^2].

7.  Second application of Cauchy–Schwarz to bound ∑ A_i^2.
    Again by Cauchy–Schwarz (or by Jensen on the convex function t↦t^2),
      ∑_{i=1}^5 A_i^2  ≥  (1/5)(∑_{i=1}^5 A_i)^2  =  (1/5)*(2S)^2  =  4S^2/5.
    Therefore
      2S^2 – ∑_{i=1}^5 A_i^2  ≤  2S^2 – (4S^2/5)  =  (10S^2/5 – 4S^2/5)  =  6S^2/5.

8.  Conclusion.
    Combining the two estimates, we obtain
      ∑_{i=1}^5 S_i  ≥  4S^2 / (2S^2 – ∑ A_i^2)
                     ≥  4S^2 / (6S^2/5)
                     =  (4 ⋅ 5)/(6)  =  20/6  =  10/3.
    Thus the original sum S satisfies S ≥ 10/3.

Hence the required inequality symbol is “≥”.  The answer is (B) ≥
