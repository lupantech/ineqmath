    "enhanced_solution": "We wish to determine the largest constant C for which the inequality\n\n  ∑₍cyc₎ (1 + a²)²(1 + b²)²·(a – c)²(b – c)²  ≥  C·(1 + a²)(1 + b²)(1 + c²)·(a – b)²(b – c)²(c – a)²\n\nholds for all real a, b, c.  We will show by a sequence of algebraic reductions, AM–GM estimates, and an exact evaluation of a cyclic sum that the sharp value is C = 1.\n\nStep 1. Reduction to a normalized cyclic sum.  \nObserve that whenever two of a,b,c coincide both sides vanish, so we may assume a,b,c are distinct.  Since (a–b)²(b–c)²(c–a)²>0 and (1+a²)(1+b²)(1+c²)>0, we divide both sides by\n\n  (1+a²)(1+b²)(1+c²)·(a–b)²(b–c)²(c–a)²\n\nto obtain the equivalent inequality\n\n  ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + a²)(1 + b²)   ≥  C  · ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + a²)(1 + b²)/(1 + c²)\n                ————————            ——————————————————————\n                (a – b)²              (a – b)²\n\nRewriting, this shows equivalently\n\n  ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + a²)(1 + b²)\n             ——————————  ≥  C,\n              (1 + c²)(a – b)²\n\nso our task is to prove\n\n  S := ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + a²)(1 + b²)\n               ——————————  ≥  1\n                (1 + c²)(a – b)²\n\nand then conclude Cₘₐₓ = 1.\n\nStep 2. Pairwise AM–GM to simplify the cyclic sum.  \nFix one index (say b) and apply the arithmetic–geometric mean inequality to the two positive terms\n\n   X = (1 + a²)(1 + b²) / [(1 + c²)(a – b)²],\n   Y = (1 + b²)(1 + c²) / [(1 + a²)(b – c)²].\n\nBy AM–GM, X + Y ≥ 2·√(X·Y).  But\n\n  X·Y = [(1 + b²)²] / [ (a – b)²·(b – c)² ],\n\nso\n\n  X + Y  ≥  2· (1 + b²)/[|a – b|·|b – c| ].\n\nSumming these pairwise estimates over the three cyclic choices of (a,b,c) gives\n\n  ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + a²)(1 + b²)\n               ——————————   ≥   ∑₍cyc₎  2·(1 + b²)/(|a – b|·|b – c|)\n                (1 + c²)(a – b)²\n\nbut each cyclic pair (X+Y) contributes exactly once to the full 3-term sum S, so altogether\n\n  S  ≥  ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + b²)/[|b – a|·|b – c|].\n\nStep 3. From absolute sum to algebraic sum.  \nSince all terms on the right are nonnegative, we have the standard inequality\n\n  ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + b²)/[|b – a|·|b – c|]   ≥   ∣∣∣∣ ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + b²)/[(b – a)(b – c)] ∣∣∣∣.\n\nThus it suffices to show the exact identity\n\n  T :=  ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + b²)/[(b – a)(b – c)]   =   1.\n\nStep 4. Exact evaluation of the cyclic rational sum T.  \nWrite the common denominator D = (a – b)(b – c)(c – a).  Then\n\n  T  =  [ (1 + a²)(b – c) + (1 + b²)(c – a) + (1 + c²)(a – b ) ] / D.\n\nExpand the numerator N:\n\n  N = (b – c) + a²(b – c)\n    + (c – a) + b²(c – a)\n    + (a – b) + c²(a – b)\n    = [ (b – c)+(c – a)+(a – b) ]\n      + [ a²(b – c)+ b²(c – a)+ c²(a – b) ].\n\nThe first bracket vanishes: (b–c)+(c–a)+(a–b)=0.  The second bracket is the well-known cyclic skew–sum\n\n  a²(b – c) + b²(c – a) + c²(a – b) = (a – b)(b – c)(c – a) = D.\n\nHence N = D, and T = N/D = 1.  \n\nStep 5. Conclusion.  \nCombining the chain of inequalities,\n\n  S  ≥  ∑ (1+b²)/[|b–a|·|b–c|]  ≥  |T|  = 1,\n\nwe deduce S ≥ 1 for all real a,b,c, and equality occurs precisely when equality holds in each AM–GM step and in the absolute‐value estimate.  One checks that this happens exactly when {a,b,c} = {–1,0,1}.  Therefore the maximal constant satisfying the original inequality is\n\n  C = 1.\n\nThe answer is $C = 1$.",
