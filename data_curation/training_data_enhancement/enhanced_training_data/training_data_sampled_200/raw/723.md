## Problem
Let $n \in \mathbb{N}, n \geq 2$. Consider the following expression:
$$
\frac{x_{1}^{5}}{x_{2}+x_{3}+\cdots+x_{n}}+\frac{x_{2}^{5}}{x_{1}+x_{3}+\cdots+x_{n}}+\cdots+\frac{x_{n}^{5}}{x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n-1}}
$$
where $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n} \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ such that $x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2}=1$.

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank:
$$
\frac{x_{1}^{5}}{x_{2}+x_{3}+\cdots+x_{n}}+\frac{x_{2}^{5}}{x_{1}+x_{3}+\cdots+x_{n}}+\cdots+\frac{x_{n}^{5}}{x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n-1}} \quad () \quad \text{minimal value}
$$

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
Let $S=x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}$. We may assume that $x_{1} \geq x_{2} \geq \cdots \geq x_{n}$.
Let $A=\frac{x_{1}^{5}}{S-x_{1}}+\frac{x_{2}^{5}}{S-x_{2}}+\cdots+\frac{x_{n}^{5}}{S-x_{n}}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_{i}^{5}}{S-x_{i}}$.
Since
$$
x_{1}^{4} \geq x_{2}^{4} \geq \cdots \geq x_{n}^{4} \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{x_{1}}{S-x_{1}} \geq \frac{x_{2}}{S-x_{2}} \geq \cdots \geq \frac{x_{n}}{S-x_{n}}
$$
we can use Chebishev's inequality.
We have $A=\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{4} \frac{x_{i}}{S-x_{i}}$.
So
$$
\begin{equation*}
A=\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{4} \frac{x_{i}}{S-x_{i}} \geq n \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{4} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_{i}}{S-x_{i}} \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

By $Q M \geq A M$ we have
$$
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{4}}{n}} \geq \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2}}{n}, \quad \text { i.e. } \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{4} \geq \frac{n}{n^{2}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2}=\frac{1}{n} \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

The function $f(x)=\frac{x}{S-x}$ is convex.
So by Jensen's inequality we have
$$
f\left(\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}}{n}\right) \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f\left(x_{i}\right)
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_{i}}{S-x_{i}} \geq \frac{\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}}{n}}{x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}-\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}}{n}}=\frac{\frac{1}{n}}{1-\frac{1}{n}}=\frac{1}{n-1}
$$
from which it follows that
$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_{i}}{S-x_{i}} \geq \frac{n}{n-1} \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

Finally using (2), (3) and (1) we obtain
$$
A \geq n \cdot \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{n}{n-1}=\frac{n}{n-1}
$$

Equality occurs if and only if $x_{1}=x_{2}=\cdots=x_{n}=1 / \sqrt{n}$. Therefore, the answer is (C) $=$.

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that for any positive real numbers x₁,x₂,…,xₙ with x₁²+⋯+xₙ²=1, the sum

    A
  = x₁⁵⁄(x₂+⋯+xₙ) + x₂⁵⁄(x₁+x₃+⋯+xₙ) + ⋯ + xₙ⁵⁄(x₁+⋯+xₙ₋₁)

satisfies a certain sharp relation with its minimal possible value.  We shall prove by a sequence of classical inequalities that

    A ≥ n⁄(n−1)

and that equality occurs exactly when all xᵢ are equal to 1/√n.

Step 1.  Notation and ordering
Let
    S = x₁ + x₂ + ⋯ + xₙ.
Without loss of generality we may renumber so that
    x₁ ≥ x₂ ≥ ⋯ ≥ xₙ > 0.
Set
    A = ∑_{i=1}^n  x_i⁵ / (S – x_i) = ∑_{i=1}^n  x_i⁴ · [x_i / (S – x_i)].

Step 2.  Chebyshev’s inequality
Observe that the two sequences
    (a_i) = (x_i⁴)  and  (b_i) = (x_i / (S – x_i))
are both positive and non-increasing in i.  By Chebyshev’s inequality, for any two similarly ordered sequences one has

    ∑_{i=1}^n a_i b_i  ≥  n · ( (1/n)∑_{i=1}^n a_i ) · ( (1/n)∑_{i=1}^n b_i ).

Applying this with a_i = x_i⁴ and b_i = x_i/(S – x_i) gives

    A = ∑ x_i⁴·(x_i/(S–x_i))
      ≥ n · ( (1/n)∑ x_i⁴ ) · ( (1/n)∑ x_i/(S–x_i) )
      = n · (∑ x_i⁴) · (∑ x_i/(S–x_i)).

Step 3.  A lower bound for ∑ x_i⁴ via QM–AM
Since x₁² + ⋯ + xₙ² = 1, by the quadratic-arithmetic mean inequality (QM ≥ AM) on the 2nd and 4th powers,

    sqrt[(x₁⁴ + ⋯ + xₙ⁴)/n]  ≥  (x₁² + ⋯ + xₙ²)/n  = 1/n.

Squaring both sides gives

    (x₁⁴ + ⋯ + xₙ⁴)  ≥  1/n.

Hence

    ∑ x_i⁴  ≥  1/n.

Step 4.  A lower bound for ∑ x_i/(S–x_i) via Jensen’s inequality
Define f(t) = t / (S – t) on (0,S).  One checks that f″(t) = 2S/(S–t)³ > 0, so f is convex.  By Jensen’s inequality on the points x₁,…,xₙ,

    f( (x₁+⋯+xₙ)/n )  ≤  (1/n)∑_{i=1}^n f(x_i).

Since (x₁+⋯+xₙ)/n = S/n and f(S/n) = (S/n)/(S – S/n) = (1/n)/(1 – 1/n) = 1/(n–1), we get

    (1/n)∑_{i=1}^n x_i/(S–x_i)  ≥  1/(n–1)
    ⇒  ∑_{i=1}^n x_i/(S–x_i)  ≥  n/(n–1).

Step 5.  Combining the estimates
From Step 2 we have
    A ≥ n · (∑ x_i⁴) · (∑ x_i/(S–x_i)).
By Step 3, ∑ x_i⁴ ≥ 1/n.  By Step 4, ∑ x_i/(S–x_i) ≥ n/(n–1).  Substituting,

    A ≥ n · (1/n) · (n/(n–1))  =  n/(n–1).

Thus the given expression is at least n/(n–1).  Moreover, in each inequality above equality holds precisely when
    x₁ = x₂ = ⋯ = xₙ = 1/√n.
Therefore the minimal possible value of the original sum is n/(n–1), attained exactly at the equal-coordinate point.

Conclusion
The correct relation is

    expression  =  minimal value

and hence, in the requested format,

The answer is (C) =
