Set\n     w₁ = 1,\n     w₂ = 2,\n     w₃ = 3,\n  and let W = w₁ + w₂ + w₃ = 6.  We will apply the weighted power‐mean inequality to the three numbers a, b, c with these weights.\n\n2.  State the weighted power‐mean inequality.  For any real exponents r < s and for any nonnegative weights wᵢ summing to W, one has\n     M_r^w(a,b,c)  ≤  M_s^w(a,b,c),\n  where\n     M_r^w(a,b,c)  =  ( (w₁·aʳ + w₂·bʳ + w₃·cʳ) / W )^(1/r),\n     M_s^w(a,b,c)  =  ( (w₁·aˢ + w₂·bˢ + w₃·cˢ) / W )^(1/s).  \n\n3.  Apply it with r = 1 and s = 2.  Then\n     M₁^w(a,b,c)  ≤  M₂^w(a,b,c).  \n  Concretely,\n     M₁^w(a,b,c)  =  (w₁·a + w₂·b + w₃·c)/W  =  (a + 2b + 3c)/6,\n     M₂^w(a,b,c)  =  [ (w₁·a² + w₂·b² + w₃·c²)/W ]^(1/2)\n                  =  sqrt( (a² + 2b² + 3c²)/6 ).\n  Hence\n     (a + 2b + 3c)/6  ≤  sqrt( (a² + 2b² + 3c²)/6 ).\n\n4.  Square both sides and clear denominators.  We obtain\n     [ (a + 2b + 3c)² / 36 ]  ≤  [ (a² + 2b² + 3c²) / 6 ],\n  so multiplying both sides by 36 gives\n     (a + 2b + 3c)²  ≤  6 · (a² + 2b² + 3c²).\n  Equivalently,\n     (a + 2b + 3c)² / (a² + 2b² + 3c²)  ≤  6.\n\n5.  Show that this bound is best possible.  We must exhibit a choice of (a,b,c) for which equality occurs.  The equality case in the weighted power‐mean inequality (for r < s) happens precisely when the three numbers a, b, c are all equal.  Thus set\n     a = b = c = k > 0.\n  Then\n     (a + 2b + 3c) = k + 2k + 3k = 6k,\n     a² + 2b² + 3c² = k² + 2k² + 3k² = 6k²,\n  and therefore\n     (a + 2b + 3c)² / (a² + 2b² + 3c²)  =  (6k)² / (6k²)  =  36k² / 6k²  =  6.\n  Hence the inequality cannot hold with any constant smaller than 6.\n\nCombining the two directions shows that the minimal constant C for which the inequality\n     (a + 2b + 3c)² / (a² + 2b² + 3c²)  ≤  C\nholds for all a,b,c>0 is exactly 6.\n\nThe answer is $C=6$",
