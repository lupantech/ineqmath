## Problem
Let $a, b, c > 0$ such that $a b c = 1$. Consider the following expressions:
$$
(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) \quad () \quad 4(a+b+c-1)
$$
Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
We will use the fact that $(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) \geq \frac{8}{9}(a+b+c)(a b+b c+c a)$. So, it is enough to prove that $\frac{2}{9}(a b+b c+c a)+\frac{1}{a+b+c} \geq 1$. Using the AM-GM Inequality, we can write

$$
\frac{2}{9}(a b+b c+c a)+\frac{1}{a+b+c} \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{(a b+b c+c a)^{2}}{81(a+b+c)}} \geq 1
$$

because

$$
(a b+b c+c a)^{2} \geq 3 a b c(a+b+c)=3(a+b+c)
$$ Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
We are given positive real numbers a,b,c with abc=1 and wish to compare

    (a+b)(b+c)(c+a)   and   4\bigl(a+b+c-1\bigr).

Our goal is to show the correct inequality sign is “≥.”  We follow the same two–step strategy as in the original outline, but fill in all intermediate details and justifications.

1.  **First lower bound for (a+b)(b+c)(c+a).**
    
    Let S=a+b+c and σ₂=ab+bc+ca.  A straightforward expansion gives

        (a+b)(b+c)(c+a)
        = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) − abc
        = S·σ₂ − 1,

    since abc=1.  We now show

        S·σ₂ − 1  ≥  (8/9)·S·σ₂.

    Equivalently,

        S·σ₂  ≥  9.

    But by the AM–GM inequality on a,b,c:

        S = a + b + c  ≥  3(abc)^{1/3} = 3·1^{1/3} = 3,

    and likewise on the three products ab,bc,ca:

        σ₂ = ab + bc + ca  ≥  3(abc)^{2/3} = 3·1^{2/3} = 3.

    Therefore,

        S·σ₂  ≥  3·3  = 9,

    which completes the proof that

        (a+b)(b+c)(c+a)  ≥  (8/9)·S·σ₂.

2.  **Reduction to a simpler inequality.**

    We now compare this bound with 4(S−1).  From

        (a+b)(b+c)(c+a)
        ≥ (8/9)·S·σ₂

    it suffices to prove

        (8/9)·S·σ₂  ≥  4(S − 1).

    Divide both sides by 4 S>0 to rewrite this as

        \frac{2}{9}\,σ₂ \;+
        \;\frac{1}{S}  \;≥\; 1.

3.  **Verification of \(2/9·σ₂ + 1/S ≥ 1\) by AM–GM.**

    Write the left–hand side as a sum of three nonnegative terms:

        \frac{2}{9}σ₂ + \frac{1}{S}
        = \underbrace{\frac{1}{9}σ₂}_{x}
        + \underbrace{\frac{1}{9}σ₂}_{y}
        + \underbrace{\frac{1}{S}}_{z}.

    By the AM–GM inequality for three nonnegative numbers x,y,z,

        (x + y + z)/3  ≥  (xyz)^{1/3}.

    Hence

        \frac{2}{9}σ₂ + \frac{1}{S}
        = x + y + z
        ≥ 3\sqrt[3]{x·y·z}
        = 3\sqrt[3]{\bigl(\tfrac{1}{9}σ₂\bigr)^2 · \tfrac{1}{S}}
        = 3\sqrt[3]{\frac{σ₂^2}{81S}}.

    Finally, observe that by another application of AM–GM,

        σ₂^2 = (ab + bc + ca)^2
             ≥ 3·ab·bc·ca·(a+b+c)
             = 3·1·S
             = 3S.

    Substituting into the cubic root gives

        3\sqrt[3]{\frac{σ₂^2}{81S}}
        ≥ 3\sqrt[3]{\frac{3S}{81S}}
        = 3\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{27}}
        = 3·\frac{1}{3}
        = 1.

    Thus we have shown

        \frac{2}{9}σ₂ + \frac{1}{S}  ≥  1,

    completing the chain

        (a+b)(b+c)(c+a)
        ≥ (8/9)·S·σ₂
        ≥ 4(S−1).

Hence the required inequality is

    (a+b)(b+c)(c+a)  ≥  4(a+b+c−1).

Answer: The answer is (B) ≥
