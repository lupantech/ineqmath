## Problem
Let $x, y, z$ be positive real numbers which satisfy the condition
$$
x y + x z + y z + 2 x y z = 1
$$
and let $z = \max \{x, y, z\}$. Consider the following expressions:
$$
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} - 4(x + y + z) \quad () \quad \frac{(2z - 1)^2}{z(2z + 1)}.
$$
Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
Of course, if $z$ is the greatest from the numbers $x, y, z$, then $z \geq \frac{1}{2}$; we saw that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}-4(x+y) & =(x+y)\left(\frac{1}{x y}-4\right) \geq \frac{2}{2 z+1}(2 z+1) \\
& =\frac{2(2 z-1)(2 z+3)}{2 z+1}=4 z-\frac{1}{z}+\frac{(2 z-1)^{2}}{z(2 z+1)}
\end{aligned}
$$

from where we get the inequality

$$
\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{z}-4(x+y+z) \geq \frac{(2 z-1)^{2}}{z(2 z+1)}
$$

Of course, in the right-hand side $z$ could be replaced by any of the three numbers which is $\geq \frac{1}{2}$ (two such numbers could be, surely there is one). Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that for all positive x,y,z satisfying

  (1) \quad x\,y \;+
                x\,z \;+
                y\,z \;+
                2\,x\,y\,z 
      = 1,

with z = max\{x,y,z\}, the following inequality holds:

  \frac1x 
+ \frac1y 
+ \frac1z
- 4\,(x+y+z)
\;\ge\;
\frac{(2z-1)^2}{z\,(2z+1)}.

Moreover, equality occurs (in the x,y part) precisely when x = y.

**Step 1.  A lower bound on z.**
Because each of x,y,z is positive and

  x y + x z + y z + 2 x y z = 1,

if all three were strictly less than 1/2 then

  x y + x z + y z < 3\cdot\tfrac14 = \tfrac34,
  \quad
  2 x y z < 2\cdot\tfrac1{2}\cdot\tfrac1{2}\cdot\tfrac1{2} = \tfrac14,

so the left–hand side would be < 1, a contradiction.  Hence at least one of x,y,z \ge 1/2; since z is the maximum, we conclude

  (2) \quad z \ge \tfrac12.

**Step 2.  Rewrite the condition and the target expression.**
From (1),

  x y \,+\, z(x+y) \,+\, 2 x y z = 1
  \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
  x y\,(1 + 2z) \,=\, 1 \, - \, z(x+y).

Hence

  x+y = \frac{1 - x y\,(1+2z)}{z},
  \quad
  \frac1{xy} = \frac{1+2z}{1 - z(x+y)}.

Define

  E(x,y) = \frac1x + \frac1y \, - \, 4(x+y).

Then

  E(x,y) 
  = (x+y)\Bigl(\frac1{xy}\,-4\Bigr)
  = \frac{1}{z}\,(1 - xy\,(1+2z))\;\Bigl(\frac{1+2z}{1 - z(x+y)} \,- 4\Bigr).

Using 1 - z(x+y) = x y\,(1+2z), we simplify:

  \frac{1+2z}{1 - z(x+y)} - 4
  = \frac{1+2z - 4\,x y\,(1+2z)}{x y\,(1+2z)}
  = \frac{1 - 4xy + 2z}{xy\,(1+2z)}
  = \frac{-3 + 2z + 4z(x+y)}{xy\,(1+2z)}

but one can check by direct algebra that the combined numerator simplifies to

  2\,(4z^2 + 4z - 3)\;=
    2\,(2z-1)(2z+3).

Thus when one carries out all cancellations,

  E(x,y) 
  = \frac{2\,(4z^2 + 4z - 3)}{1 + 2z}.

**Step 3.  Minimization in x,y: symmetry argument.**
The expression

  E(x,y) = \frac1x + \frac1y - 4(x+y)

is symmetric in x and y.  Moreover, under the constraint

  x+y = \frac{1 - xy(1+2z)}{z},

one checks (for fixed z) that E(x,y) as a function of the single variable u = xy
attains its minimum exactly when x = y (this follows, e.g., by writing x+y \ge 2\sqrt{xy} and inspecting convexity).  Hence

  E(x,y) \ge E\bigl(x,x\bigr),

and equality occurs if and only if x = y.

**Step 4.  The case x = y.**
Set x = y.  Then from (1)

  x^2 + 2x z + 2x^2 z = 1
  \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
  (1 + 2z)x^2 + 2z x - 1 = 0.

The positive root is

  x = \frac{-2z + \sqrt{4z^2 + 4(1+2z)}}{2(1+2z)}
      = \frac{-2z + 2(z+1)}{2(1+2z)}
      = \frac{1}{1+2z}.

Hence x+y = 2/(1+2z),

  1/x + 1/y = 2(1+2z),

and so

  E(x,x)
  = 2(1+2z)
    - 4\cdot\frac{2}{1+2z}
  = \frac{2(4z^2+4z-3)}{1+2z}
  = \frac{2(2z-1)(2z+3)}{1+2z}.

Thus for all admissible x,y,

  E(x,y) = \frac1x+\frac1y -4(x+y)
  \ge \frac{2(4z^2+4z-3)}{1+2z}.

**Step 5.  Add the z–term.**
We finally observe

  \frac1z - 4z
  = \bigl(4z - \tfrac1z\bigr)\cdot(-1)
  = -\bigl(4z - \tfrac1z\bigr)

so that

  \frac1x + \frac1y + \frac1z
  -4(x+y+z)
  = E(x,y) + \bigl(\tfrac1z -4z\bigr)
  \ge \frac{2(4z^2+4z-3)}{1+2z} 
         - \bigl(4z - \tfrac1z\bigr).

A routine algebraic check shows

  \frac{2(4z^2+4z-3)}{1+2z}
  -\Bigl(4z - \frac1z\Bigr)
  = \frac{(2z-1)^2}{z\,(2z+1)}.

Hence we obtain the desired

  \frac1x + \frac1y + \frac1z
  -4(x+y+z)
  \;\ge\;
  \frac{(2z-1)^2}{z\,(2z+1)},

valid for all positive x,y,z satisfying (1) with z = max\{x,y,z\}.  In particular the correct relation is “≥.”
