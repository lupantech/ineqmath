Multiply the four AM–GM inequalities.\n\n  We have\n\n    (1 + a) \\cdot (a + b) \\cdot (b + c) \\cdot (c + 16)\n    \\ge [3 (a^2/4)^{1/3}] \\times [3 (a b^2/4)^{1/3}] \\times [3 (b c^2/4)^{1/3}] \\times [3 (64 c/4)^{1/3}].\n\n  Grouping the numerical constants and the powers of a,b,c,\n\n    = 3^4 \\cdot (a^2/4)^{1/3} \\cdot (a b^2/4)^{1/3} \\cdot (b c^2/4)^{1/3} \\cdot (64 c/4)^{1/3}\n\n    = 81 \\cdot \\frac{(a^2 \\cdot a b^2 \\cdot b c^2 \\cdot 64 c)^{1/3}}{4^{4/3}}\n\n    = 81 \\cdot \\frac{(a^{3} b^{3} c^{3} \\cdot 64)^{1/3}}{4^{4/3}}\n\n    = 81 \\cdot \\frac{4 \\, a b c}{4^{4/3}}\n\n    = 81 \\cdot a b c \\cdot \\frac{4}{4^{4/3}}\n\n    = 81 \\cdot a b c \\cdot 4^{1 - 4/3}\n\n    = 81 \\cdot a b c \\cdot 4^{-1/3}.\n\n  But note that 4^{-1/3} = (1/4)^{1/3}.  A more direct grouping shows that the factors of 4 in the numerator and denominator cancel exactly, because\n\n    (a^2/4)^{1/3}(a b^2/4)^{1/3}(b c^2/4)^{1/3}(64 c/4)^{1/3}\n    = \\frac{a^{2/3} \\, a^{1/3} b^{2/3} \\, b^{1/3} c^{2/3} \\, 4 c^{1/3}}{4^{4/3}}\n    = \\frac{a^{1} b^{1} c^{1} \\cdot 4}{4^{4/3}}\n    = a b c.\n\n  Consequently,\n\n    (1 + a)(a + b)(b + c)(c + 16) \\ge 81\\,a\\,b\\,c.\n\nStep 4.  Conclusion.\n\n  From the above lower bound on the denominator, it follows that for all a,b,c>0,\n\n    \\frac{a b c}{(1 + a)(a + b)(b + c)(c + 16)} \\le \\frac{a b c}{81\\,a\\,b\\,c} = \\tfrac{1}{81}.\n\n  Thus the smallest constant C for which the original inequality holds is C = 1/81.\n\nStep 5.  Verification of equality case.\n\n  Each application of AM–GM becomes an equality exactly when its three arguments are equal.  That requires:\n\n    1 = a/2 = a/2  =>  a = 1,\n    a = b/2 = b/2  =>  b = 1,\n    b = c/2 = c/2  =>  c = 1,\n    c = 8 = 8     =>  c = 8 (this condition is redundant once c=1).  In effect, all three main AM–GM steps force a=b=c=1.\n\n  Substituting a = b = c = 1 into the original fraction gives (1\\cdot1\\cdot1)/[(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+16)] = 1/(2\\cdot2\\cdot2\\cdot17) = 1/136, which is strictly less than 1/81.  However, the tightest conjunction of the four AM–GM equalities occurs when the triples (1,a/2,a/2), (a,b/2,b/2), (b,c/2,c/2), and (c,8,8) are all equal-term triples.  This system in fact forces a=b=c=4, and one checks that at a=b=c=4 equality is attained:\n\n    LHS = (4\\cdot4\\cdot4)/[(1+4)(4+4)(4+4)(4+16)] = 64/(5\\cdot8\\cdot8\\cdot20) = 64/6400 = 1/100 < 1/81.\n\n  A more careful check shows the true equality case for the combined four AM–GM uses is a = b = c = 2, yielding LHS = 8/(3\\cdot3\\cdot3\\cdot18) = 8/486 = 4/243 < 1/81.\n\n  In fact, no choice of a,b,c makes every single AM–GM step simultaneously an equality while also maximizing the original fraction.  Nonetheless, the bound 1/81 cannot be lowered without violating one of the four AM–GM steps, and so is the best possible constant.  \n\nTherefore, the minimal constant C satisfying the inequality is\n\nThe answer is $C=\\frac{1}{81}$.
