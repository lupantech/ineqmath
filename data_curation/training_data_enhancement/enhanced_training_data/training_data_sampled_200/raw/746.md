## Problem
Let $a, b, c, x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. Consider the following inequality:
$$
\frac{a^{3}}{x}+\frac{b^{3}}{y}+\frac{c^{3}}{z} \quad () \quad \frac{(a+b+c)^{3}}{3(x+y+z)} .
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
By the generalized Hölder's inequality (or simply Hölder's inequality) we have
$$
\left(\frac{a^{3}}{x}+\frac{b^{3}}{y}+\frac{c^{3}}{z}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}(1+1+1)^{\frac{1}{3}}(x+y+z)^{\frac{1}{3}} \geq a+b+c
$$
and the conclusion follows. Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that for all positive real numbers a,b,c,x,y,z the following holds:

  (1)     a^{3}/x + b^{3}/y + c^{3}/z   ≥   (a + b + c)^{3}  /  [ 3(x + y + z) ].

In other words, we must decide which symbol from {≤, ≥, =, <, >} correctly fills the blank

      a^{3}/x + b^{3}/y + c^{3}/z   (   )   (a + b + c)^{3} / [3(x + y + z)].

Original solution uses Hölder’s inequality. We now give a fully detailed derivation.

Step 1  (Statement of Hölder’s inequality).
Let p, q, r be positive real exponents satisfying 1/p + 1/q + 1/r = 1.  For any nonnegative sequences (u_{i}), (v_{i}), (w_{i}) of the same length, Hölder’s inequality states:

   Σ_{i} (u_{i} v_{i} w_{i})   ≤   ( Σ_{i} u_{i}^{p} )^{1/p} · ( Σ_{i} v_{i}^{q} )^{1/q} · ( Σ_{i} w_{i}^{r} )^{1/r}.

We apply this with three terms (i=1,2,3) and choose p = q = r = 3.  Note that then 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1, so the condition on the exponents is satisfied.

Step 2  (Defining the three sequences).
We set up three sequences of length 3 as follows:

  For i=1, take
     u_{1} = a / x^{1/3},
     v_{1} = 1,
     w_{1} = x^{1/3}.
  For i=2, take
     u_{2} = b / y^{1/3},
     v_{2} = 1,
     w_{2} = y^{1/3}.
  For i=3, take
     u_{3} = c / z^{1/3},
     v_{3} = 1,
     w_{3} = z^{1/3}.

Observe that for each i,
   u_{i}·v_{i}·w_{i} = ( [a or b or c] / [the corresponding root of x,y,z] ) × 1 × ([the same root])
                         = a, b, or c respectively.
Hence

   Σ_{i=1}^{3} u_{i} v_{i} w_{i}   = a + b + c.

Step 3  (Computing each norm).
Since p = 3, we compute

  (Σ u_{i}^{3})^{1/3}  = [ (a^{3}/x) + (b^{3}/y) + (c^{3}/z ) ]^{1/3},

  (Σ v_{i}^{3})^{1/3}  = [ 1^{3} + 1^{3} + 1^{3} ]^{1/3} = 3^{1/3},

  (Σ w_{i}^{3})^{1/3}  = [ x + y + z ]^{1/3}.

Step 4  (Applying Hölder).
Plugging into Hölder’s inequality for p=q=r=3 yields

   Σ u_{i} v_{i} w_{i}
   ≤   (Σ u_{i}^{3})^{1/3} · (Σ v_{i}^{3})^{1/3} · (Σ w_{i}^{3})^{1/3}

   i.e.

   a + b + c  ≤  [ (a^{3}/x) + (b^{3}/y) + (c^{3}/z ) ]^{1/3} ⋅ 3^{1/3} ⋅ (x + y + z)^{1/3}.

Step 5  (Algebraic rearrangement).
Raise both sides to the third power (permissible since both sides are nonnegative):

   (a + b + c)^{3}
   ≤  [ (a^{3}/x) + (b^{3}/y) + (c^{3}/z ) ] · 3 · (x + y + z).

Next, divide both sides by [3(x + y + z)], which is positive:

   [ (a + b + c)^{3} ]  /  [3(x + y + z)]   ≤   (a^{3}/x) + (b^{3}/y) + (c^{3}/z).

This is exactly the statement

   a^{3}/x + b^{3}/y + c^{3}/z   ≥   (a + b + c)^{3}/[3(x + y + z)].

Step 6  (Conclusion).
We have shown via a valid application of Hölder’s inequality and straightforward algebraic steps that the left–hand side is at least as large as the right–hand side.  Hence the correct relation is “≥.”

Therefore, in the requested format:

The answer is (B) ≥.
