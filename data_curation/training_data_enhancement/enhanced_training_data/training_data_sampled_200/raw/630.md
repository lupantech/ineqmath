## Problem
Let $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$ be non-negative real numbers such that $x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n} \leq \frac{1}{2}$. Consider the following inequality:
$$
\left(1-x_{1}\right)\left(1-x_{2}\right) \cdots\left(1-x_{n}\right) \quad () \quad \frac{1}{2} .
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
From $x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n} \leq \frac{1}{2}$ and the fact that $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$ are nonnegative we deduce that
$$
0 \leq x_{i} \leq \frac{1}{2}<1, \quad \text { i.e. } \quad-x_{i}>-1, \quad \text { for all } i=1,2, \ldots, n
$$
and it's clear that all $-x_{i}$ are of the same sign.
Applying Bernoulli's inequality we obtain
$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(1-x_{1}\right)\left(1-x_{2}\right) \cdots\left(1-x_{n}\right) & =\left(1+\left(-x_{1}\right)\right)\left(1+\left(-x_{2}\right)\right) \cdots\left(1+\left(-x_{n}\right)\right) \\
& \geq 1+\left(-x_{1}-x_{2}-\cdots-x_{n}\right) \\
& =1-\left(x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}\right) \geq 1-\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$ Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We are given non-negative real numbers x₁, x₂, …, xₙ satisfying

    x₁ + x₂ + … + xₙ ≤ 1/2,

and we wish to compare the product

    P = (1 − x₁)(1 − x₂)⋯(1 − xₙ)

with 1/2.  We will show in a sequence of clear, rigorous steps that P ≥ 1/2.

Step 1.  Bound each xᵢ and define auxiliary variables.
Since xᵢ ≥ 0 for each i and the total sum is at most 1/2, we have

    0 ≤ xᵢ ≤ 1/2 < 1,

for all i = 1, 2, …, n.  Define yᵢ = −xᵢ.  Then for each i,

    yᵢ ≤ 0   and   yᵢ ≥ −1,

so that −1 ≤ yᵢ ≤ 0.  Notice in particular that all the yᵢ have the same sign (namely, nonpositive).

Step 2.  Expand the product in terms of the yᵢ.

    P = ∏_{i=1}^n (1 − xᵢ)
      = ∏_{i=1}^n (1 + yᵢ).

When we expand this product, we get a sum of terms of the form

    1  +  Σ yᵢ  +  Σ_{i<j} (yᵢ yⱼ)  +  Σ_{i<j<k} (yᵢ yⱼ y_k)  +  …  +  (y₁ y₂⋯yₙ).

Step 3.  Observe that all higher-order terms are nonnegative.
Because each yᵢ ≤ 0, any product yᵢ yⱼ of two or more such factors satisfies

    yᵢ yⱼ ≥ 0,

and similarly any product of three or more of the yᵢ is also ≥ 0.  Therefore, in the full expansion,

    ∑_{i<j} (yᵢ yⱼ)  +  ∑_{i<j<k} (yᵢ yⱼ y_k)  +  …  +  (y₁·y₂·…·yₙ)  ≥ 0.

It follows that

    P = ∏_{i=1}^n (1 + yᵢ)
      = 1 + Σ_{i=1}^n yᵢ  +  (nonnegative terms)
      ≥ 1 + Σ_{i=1}^n yᵢ.

Substituting back yᵢ = −xᵢ gives

    P ≥ 1 − (x₁ + x₂ + … + xₙ).

Step 4.  Use the given sum bound.
Since x₁ + x₂ + … + xₙ ≤ 1/2, we obtain

    P ≥ 1 − (x₁ + x₂ + … + xₙ)
      ≥ 1 − 1/2
      = 1/2.

Conclusion.
We have shown that

    (1 − x₁)(1 − x₂)⋯(1 − xₙ)  ≥  1/2.

Hence the correct relational symbol to fill the blank in

    (1 − x₁)(1 − x₂)⋯(1 − xₙ)  (   )  1/2

is “≥.”

The answer is (B) ≥
