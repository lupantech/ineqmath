    "enhanced_solution": "We are given positive real numbers a,b,c satisfying\na + b + c \\;≥\\; 1/a + 1/b + 1/c.\nWe wish to find the largest constant C such that for all such a,b,c the following holds:\n\n    a + b + c \\;≥\\;  C/(a + b + c)  +  2/(a b c).\n\nThe original solution proceeds in two main steps, using standard mean-inequalities and an algebraic identity.  We now give a more detailed, step-by-step justification, without altering the core approach.\n\nStep 1.  From the given constraint a + b + c ≥ 1/a + 1/b + 1/c, apply the classical inequality between the arithmetic mean (AM) and the harmonic mean (HM) to the three numbers a,b,c itself:\n\n    AM = (a + b + c)/3,    HM = 3/(1/a + 1/b + 1/c).\n\nBy AM ≥ HM we have\n\n    (a + b + c)/3  ≥  3/(1/a + 1/b + 1/c).\n\nSince by assumption a + b + c  ≥  1/a + 1/b + 1/c, the denominator on the right   1/a + 1/b + 1/c  is at most   a + b + c.  Hence\n\n    (a + b + c)/3  ≥  3/(a + b + c).\n\nWe label this intermediate bound as (1):\n\n    (1)   (a + b + c)/3  ≥  3/(a + b + c).\n\nStep 2.  We next derive a lower bound of the form a + b + c ≥ 3/(a b c).  To do so, start again from the assumption a + b + c ≥ 1/a + 1/b + 1/c, square both sides (permitted since everything is positive):\n\n    (a + b + c)²  ≥  (1/a + 1/b + 1/c)².\n\nA well-known algebraic inequality (which can be proved, for instance, by expanding or by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality) states that for any positive x,y,z,\n\n    (x + y + z)²  ≥  3(xy + yz + zx).\n\nApply this with x=1/a, y=1/b, z=1/c.  We get\n\n    (1/a + 1/b + 1/c)²  ≥  3(1/(a b) + 1/(b c) + 1/(c a)).\n\nCombine with the previous line:\n\n    (a + b + c)²  ≥  3 \\bigl( 1/(a b) + 1/(b c) + 1/(c a) \\bigr).\n\nBut observe that\n\n    1/(a b) + 1/(b c) + 1/(c a)  =  (a + b + c)/(a b c).\n\nIndeed,\n    1/(a b) + 1/(b c) + 1/(c a)\n  =  (c + a + b)/(a b c)\n  =  (a + b + c)/(a b c)\n\nbecause all three cyclic sums coincide.  Therefore,\n\n    (a + b + c)²  ≥  3 ⋅ (a + b + c)/(a b c).\n\nSince a + b + c > 0, we may divide both sides by a + b + c, yielding\n\n    a + b + c  ≥  3/(a b c).\n\nWe rewrite this as\n\n    (2)   2(a + b + c)/3  ≥  2/(a b c).\n\nStep 3.  We now linearly combine the two bounds (1) and (2) so as to recover the desired inequality with the optimal constant.  Namely, multiply (1) by 1 and (2) by 1, then add term by term:\n\n    From (1):    (a + b + c)/3  ≥  3/(a + b + c),\n    From (2):    2(a + b + c)/3  ≥  2/(a b c).\n\nAdding gives\n\n    (a + b + c)/3  +  2(a + b + c)/3\n      =  (a + b + c)\n      ≥  3/(a + b + c)  +  2/(a b c).\n\nThis is exactly the inequality we wanted, with C = 3:\n\n    a + b + c  ≥  3/(a + b + c)  +  2/(a b c).\n\nStep 4.  We check that equality can occur (so the constant is best possible).  Take a = b = c = 1.  Then:\n\n    a + b + c = 3,\n    1/a + 1/b + 1/c = 3  ⇒  constraint holds at equality,\n    a b c = 1,\n\nand the right-hand side becomes\n\n    3/(a + b + c) + 2/(a b c) = 3/3 + 2/1 = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nThus equality holds in the final inequality for a = b = c = 1, showing that no larger C can work.  We conclude that the largest constant is C = 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $C=3$.",
