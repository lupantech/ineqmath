## Problem
Let $a, b, c > 1$ be positive real numbers such that 
$$
\frac{1}{a^{2}-1}+\frac{1}{b^{2}-1}+\frac{1}{c^{2}-1}=1.
$$
Consider the following expressions:
$$
\frac{1}{a+1}+\frac{1}{b+1}+\frac{1}{c+1} \quad () \quad 1.
$$
Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
Without loss of generality we may assume that $a \geq b \geq c$. Then we have
$$
\frac{a-2}{a+1} \geq \frac{b-2}{b+1} \geq \frac{c-2}{c+1} \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{a+2}{a-1} \leq \frac{b+2}{b-1} \leq \frac{c+2}{c-1}
$$

Now by Chebishev's inequality we get
$$
\begin{aligned}
3\left(\frac{a^{2}-4}{a^{2}-1}+\frac{b^{2}-4}{b^{2}-1}+\frac{c^{2}-4}{c^{2}-1}\right) \leq & \left(\frac{a-2}{a+1}+\frac{b-2}{b+1}+\frac{c-2}{c+1}\right) \\
& \times\left(\frac{a+2}{a-1}+\frac{b+2}{b-1}+\frac{c+2}{c-1}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Since
$$
\frac{a^{2}-4}{a^{2}-1}+\frac{b^{2}-4}{b^{2}-1}+\frac{c^{2}-4}{c^{2}-1}=3-3\left(\frac{1}{a^{2}-1}+\frac{1}{b^{2}-1}+\frac{1}{c^{2}-1}\right)=0
$$
and
$$
\frac{a+2}{a-1}+\frac{b+2}{b-1}+\frac{c+2}{c-1}>0
$$
we must have
$$
\frac{a-2}{a+1}+\frac{b-2}{b+1}+\frac{c-2}{c+1} \geq 0
$$
which is equivalent to $\frac{1}{a+1}+\frac{1}{b+1}+\frac{1}{c+1} \leq 1$, as required.
Equality holds iff $a=b=c=2$. Therefore, the answer is (A) $\leq$.

## Expected Answer
(A) $\leq$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Step-by-Step Solution:

1.  Rewriting the given constraint
    We are given three real numbers a,b,c>1 satisfying
    \[
      \frac{1}{a^{2}-1} + \frac{1}{b^{2}-1} + \frac{1}{c^{2}-1} = 1.
    \]
    Notice that for each x>1, x^{2}-1>0, so all terms in the sum are positive.

2.  Introducing auxiliary functions and their monotonicity

    Define two real-valued functions for x>1:

    \[
      f(x) = \frac{x-2}{x+1},
      \quad
      g(x) = \frac{x+2}{x-1}.
    \]

    We check their derivatives to determine monotonicity:

    (i)  f'(x)
        = \frac{(1)(x+1) - (x-2)(1)}{(x+1)^{2}}
        = \frac{x+1 - x +2}{(x+1)^{2}}
        = \frac{3}{(x+1)^{2}} > 0
        for all x>1.
        Hence f is strictly increasing on (1,\infty).  

    (ii) g'(x)
        = \frac{(1)(x-1) - (x+2)(1)}{(x-1)^{2}}
        = \frac{x-1 - x -2}{(x-1)^{2}}
        = \frac{-3}{(x-1)^{2}} < 0
        for all x>1.
        Hence g is strictly decreasing on (1,\infty).

3.  Ordering of a,b,c and induced order of f(a),f(b),f(c) and g(a),g(b),g(c)

    Without loss of generality, assume
    \[ a \ge b \ge c > 1. \]
    Then by the monotonicity just established:

    •  Since f is increasing, we have
       \[ f(a) \ge f(b) \ge f(c). \]

    •  Since g is decreasing, we have
       \[ g(a) \le g(b) \le g(c). \]

    Thus the two sequences (f(a),f(b),f(c)) and (g(a),g(b),g(c)) are oppositely sorted.

4.  Applying Chebyshev’s inequality in the reversed sense

    Chebyshev's inequality states that for two sequences (x_{i}) and (y_{i}) of real numbers that are similarly sorted (both increasing or both decreasing),
    \[
      \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i} \ge \Bigl(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\Bigr)
      \Bigl(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\Bigr).
    \]
    If the sequences are oppositely sorted (one increasing, the other decreasing), the inequality reverses:
    \[
      \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i} \le \Bigl(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\Bigr)
      \Bigl(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\Bigr).
    \]

    Here n=3, x_{1}=f(a), x_{2}=f(b), x_{3}=f(c), y_{1}=g(a), y_{2}=g(b), y_{3}=g(c).
    Since (f(a),f(b),f(c)) is increasing and (g(a),g(b),g(c)) is decreasing, we have

    \[
      \frac{1}{3}\bigl(f(a)g(a) + f(b)g(b) + f(c)g(c)\bigr)
      \le \Bigl(\frac{1}{3}(f(a)+f(b)+f(c))\Bigr)
      \Bigl(\frac{1}{3}(g(a)+g(b)+g(c))\Bigr).
    \]

    Multiplying both sides by 9 yields the equivalent form:

    \[
      3\bigl(f(a)g(a) + f(b)g(b) + f(c)g(c)\bigr)
      \le \bigl(f(a)+f(b)+f(c)\bigr)
           \bigl(g(a)+g(b)+g(c)\bigr).
    \]

5.  Evaluating the product sums

    First observe for each x>1:
    \[
      f(x)g(x)
      = \frac{x-2}{x+1} \cdot \frac{x+2}{x-1}
      = \frac{x^{2}-4}{x^{2}-1}.
    \]
    Hence

    \[
      \sum_{\text{cyc}} f(x)g(x)
      = \sum_{\text{cyc}} \frac{x^{2}-4}{x^{2}-1}
      = \sum_{\text{cyc}} \Bigl(1 - \frac{3}{x^{2}-1}\Bigr)
      = 3 - 3 \sum_{\text{cyc}} \frac{1}{x^{2}-1}.
    \]
    By the given constraint, \(\sum 1/(x^{2}-1)=1\), so

    \[
      f(a)g(a) + f(b)g(b) + f(c)g(c) = 3 - 3\cdot1 = 0.
    \]

    Also note that for each x>1, g(x)=(x+2)/(x-1)>0, so
    \[
      g(a)+g(b)+g(c)>0.
    \]

6.  Deducing the key inequality

    Substituting these into the Chebyshev inequality from step 4:

    \[
      3\cdot0 \le (f(a)+f(b)+f(c))\,(g(a)+g(b)+g(c))
      \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
      f(a)+f(b)+f(c) \ge 0.
    \]

    Writing f(x)=(x-2)/(x+1)=1 - 3/(x+1), we get

    \[
      f(a)+f(b)+f(c)
      = 3 - 3\Bigl(\frac{1}{a+1}+\frac{1}{b+1}+\frac{1}{c+1}\Bigr)
      \ge 0
      \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
      \frac{1}{a+1}+\frac{1}{b+1}+\frac{1}{c+1} \le 1.
    \]

7.  Conclusion and equality case

    We have shown the required inequality

    \[
      \frac{1}{a+1}+\frac{1}{b+1}+\frac{1}{c+1} \le 1.
    \]

    Equality in Chebyshev’s reversed inequality occurs precisely when the two sequences
    are constant on their indices, i.e. f(a)=f(b)=f(c) and g(a)=g(b)=g(c).  Since f and g are strictly monotonic,
    this forces a=b=c.  Then the original constraint 3/(a^{2}-1)=1 gives a^{2}-1=3, so a=2.
    Hence equality holds if and only if a=b=c=2.

Therefore, the correct relation is “≤”.  The answer is (A) ≤
