Positivity of each ratio.\nBecause a, b, c are side-lengths of a triangle, each of the three quantities (a + b − c), (b + c − a), (c + a − b) is strictly positive. Hence all expressions in (1) are well defined and positive.\n\nStep 2.  Reformulate via weighted exponents.\nLet S = a + b + c.  Define weights\n\n    α = a⁄S,\n    β = b⁄S,\n    γ = c⁄S.\n\nThen α + β + γ = 1 and each weight is positive.  Rewrite the left-hand side of (1) as\n\n    (a + b − c)^{a}·(b + c − a)^{b}·(c + a − b)^{c}\n    =\n    \bigl[(a + b − c)⁄a\bigr]^{a}·a^{a}\n    ·\bigl[(b + c − a)⁄b\bigr]^{b}·b^{b}\n    ·\bigl[(c + a − b)⁄c\bigr]^{c}·c^{c}.\n\nDividing both sides of (1) by a^{a} b^{b} c^{c}, the inequality is equivalent to\n\n    (2)    \bigl[(a + b − c)⁄a\bigr]^{a}  ·  \bigl[(b + c − a)⁄b\bigr]^{b}  ·  \bigl[(c + a − b)⁄c\bigr]^{c}\n            ≤   C.\n\nStep 3.  Apply weighted AM–GM to the three positive numbers X = (a + b − c)/a, Y = (b + c − a)/b, Z = (c + a − b)/c.\nBy the weighted arithmetic mean–geometric mean inequality, we have\n\n    X^{α}·Y^{β}·Z^{γ}\n    ≤ α·X + β·Y + γ·Z.\n\nObserve that\n\n    α·X + β·Y + γ·Z\n    = (a/S)·((a + b − c)/a) + (b/S)·((b + c − a)/b) + (c/S)·((c + a − b)/c)\n    = [(a + b − c) + (b + c − a) + (c + a − b)] / S\n    = [2(a + b + c) − (a + b + c)] / S\n    = (a + b + c)/S = 1.\n\nTherefore\n\n    X^{α}·Y^{β}·Z^{γ}  ≤  1,\n\nwhich is the same as\n\n    \bigl[(a + b − c)⁄a\bigr]^{a/S}\n    ·\bigl[(b + c − a)⁄b\bigr]^{b/S}\n    ·\bigl[(c + a − b)⁄c\bigr]^{c/S}\n    ≤ 1.\n\nRaising both sides to the power S = a + b + c > 0 yields exactly inequality (2) with C = 1.\n\nStep 4.  Minimality of C = 1.\nTo see that no smaller constant can work, note that in the case a = b = c (an equilateral triangle) we have a + b − c = b + c − a = c + a − b = a.  Hence\n\n    (a + b − c)^{a}·(b + c − a)^{b}·(c + a − b)^{c}\n    = a^{a}·a^{b}·a^{c} = a^{a+b+c}\n    = a^{a}·b^{b}·c^{c},\n\nso both sides of (1) are equal and C cannot be taken below 1.\n\nConclusion.\nCombining the above, the sharp (smallest) value of the constant is C = 1.\n\nThe answer is $C=1$",
