## Problem
Let $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ such that $\frac{1}{1+a^{4}}+\frac{1}{1+b^{4}}+\frac{1}{1+c^{4}}+\frac{1}{1+d^{4}}=1$. Determine the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d$:
$$
a b c d \geq C.
$$

## Current Solution
We'll use the following substitutions
$$
\frac{1}{1+a^{4}}=x, \quad \frac{1}{1+b^{4}}=y, \quad \frac{1}{1+c^{4}}=z, \quad \frac{1}{1+d^{4}}=t
$$

Then we obtain $x+y+z+t=1$ and $a^{4}=\frac{1-x}{x}, b^{4}=\frac{1-y}{y}, c^{4}=\frac{1-z}{z}, d^{4}=\frac{1-t}{t}$.

We need to show that
$$
a^{4} b^{4} c^{4} d^{4} \geq 81
$$
i.e.
$$
\frac{1-x}{x} \cdot \frac{1-y}{y} \cdot \frac{1-z}{z} \cdot \frac{1-t}{t} \geq 81
$$

Applying $A M \geq G M$ we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1-x}{x} \cdot \frac{1-y}{y} \cdot \frac{1-z}{z} \cdot \frac{1-t}{t} & =\frac{y+z+t}{x} \cdot \frac{x+z+t}{y} \cdot \frac{x+y+t}{z} \cdot \frac{x+y+z}{t} \\
& \geq \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{y z t}}{x} \cdot \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{x z t}}{y} \cdot \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{x y t}}{z} \cdot \frac{3 \sqrt[3]{x y z}}{t}=81
\end{aligned}
$$
as desired.

Equality holds when $x = y = z = t = \frac{1}{4}$, which corresponds to $a = b = c = d = 3^{1/4}$. In this case, $a b c d = (3^{1/4})^4 = 3$. Thus, this gives the minimum value of $a b c d$, so the largest constant $C$ is $3$.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 3$. 

## Expected Answer
$C = 3$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to find the largest constant C such that for all positive real numbers a,b,c,d satisfying

  (1) \quad 1/(1+a^4) + 1/(1+b^4) + 1/(1+c^4) + 1/(1+d^4) = 1,

one has

  a b c d \ge C.

Our strategy is to introduce convenient variables for the four fractions, rewrite the product a b c d in terms of these variables, and then apply the AM–GM inequality to obtain a lower bound.

Step 1: Substitution of variables.  Define positive variables x,y,z,t by

  x = 1/(1 + a^4),
  y = 1/(1 + b^4),
  z = 1/(1 + c^4),
  t = 1/(1 + d^4).

Since a,b,c,d are positive reals, each denominator 1 + a^4, etc., exceeds 1, so each of x,y,z,t lies strictly between 0 and 1.  The given condition becomes

  x + y + z + t = 1.                                  (2)

Moreover, from x = 1/(1+a^4) we solve for a^4:

  a^4 = (1 - x)/x,
  b^4 = (1 - y)/y,
  c^4 = (1 - z)/z,
  d^4 = (1 - t)/t.

Step 2: Express the product a^4 b^4 c^4 d^4.  We have

  a^4 b^4 c^4 d^4
  = [(1 - x)/x] · [(1 - y)/y] · [(1 - z)/z] · [(1 - t)/t].

Observe that 1 - x = y + z + t by (2), and similarly for the others.  Hence

  a^4 b^4 c^4 d^4
  = [(y + z + t)/x] · [(x + z + t)/y] · [(x + y + t)/z] · [(x + y + z)/t].

Step 3: Application of the AM–GM inequality.  For any three positive numbers u,v,w, the Arithmetic–Geometric Mean inequality gives

  (u + v + w)/3 \ge (u v w)^{1/3},

with equality precisely when u = v = w.  Applying this to each triple in the numerators yields:

  y + z + t \ge 3 (y z t)^{1/3},
  x + z + t \ge 3 (x z t)^{1/3},
  x + y + t \ge 3 (x y t)^{1/3},
  x + y + z \ge 3 (x y z)^{1/3}.

Since x,y,z,t > 0, we may divide each of these inequalities by the corresponding denominator x,y,z,t, respectively, to obtain:

  (y + z + t)/x \ge 3 (y z t)^{1/3}/x,
  (x + z + t)/y \ge 3 (x z t)^{1/3}/y,
  (x + y + t)/z \ge 3 (x y t)^{1/3}/z,
  (x + y + z)/t \ge 3 (x y z)^{1/3}/t.

Step 4: Combine the four inequalities.  Multiplying them side by side (all factors are positive) gives:

  [(y + z + t)/x] · [(x + z + t)/y] · [(x + y + t)/z] · [(x + y + z)/t]
    \ge 3^4 \;[ (y z t)·(x z t)·(x y t)·(x y z) ]^{1/3} \;/\;(x y z t).

Compute the product inside the brackets:

  (y z t)·(x z t)·(x y t)·(x y z)
  = x^3 y^3 z^3 t^3.

Hence its one-third power is

  (x^3 y^3 z^3 t^3)^{1/3} = x y z t.

Substituting back,

  a^4 b^4 c^4 d^4
    = [(y + z + t)/x]·…·[(x + y + z)/t]
    \ge 3^4 · (x y z t)/(x y z t)
    = 81.

Therefore

  a b c d \ge (a^4 b^4 c^4 d^4)^{1/4} \ge 81^{1/4} = 3.

Step 5: Verification of the equality case.  Equality in the AM–GM step occurs exactly when

  y = z = t,
  x = z = t,
  x = y = t,
  x = y = z,

i.e.

  x = y = z = t = 1/4.

Then from a^4 = (1 - x)/x = (3/4)/(1/4) = 3, we get a = 3^{1/4}, and similarly b = c = d = 3^{1/4}.  In this case

  a b c d = (3^{1/4})^4 = 3,

so the bound is attained.  Thus the largest constant C for which the given inequality holds for all positive a,b,c,d under the stated constraint is

The answer is $C = 3$
