## Problem
Let $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$:
$$
\frac{a}{b+2 c}+\frac{b}{c+2 a}+\frac{c}{a+2 b} \geq C
$$

## Current Solution
Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we get
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left(\frac{a}{b+2 c}+\frac{b}{c+2 a}+\frac{c}{a+2 b}\right)(a(b+2 c)+b(c+2 a)+c(a+2 b)) \\
& \quad \geq(a+b+c)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
hence
$$
\frac{a}{b+2 c}+\frac{b}{c+2 a}+\frac{c}{a+2 b} \geq \frac{(a+b+c)^{2}}{3(a b+b c+c a)}
$$

So it suffices to show that
$$
\frac{(a+b+c)^{2}}{3(a b+b c+c a)} \geq 1, \quad \text { i.e. } \quad(a+b+c)^{2} \geq 3(a b+b c+c a)
$$
which is equivalent to $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2} \geq a b+b c+c a$, and clearly holds.
Equality occurs iff $a=b=c$.

Equality holds when $a = b = c$, in which case $\frac{a}{b+2c} + \frac{b}{c+2a} + \frac{c}{a+2b} = 1$. This gives the minimum value of the expression, so $C = 1$ is the largest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 1$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 1$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that for all positive real numbers a, b, c the expression

    S = a/(b+2c) + b/(c+2a) + c/(a+2b)

satisfies S ≥ C, and to determine the largest possible constant C.

Step 1: Apply the Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality

We observe that each term a/(b+2c) can be paired with a positive weight.  By the standard form of Cauchy–Schwarz,

    (x₁² + x₂² + x₃²)(y₁² + y₂² + y₃²) ≥ (x₁y₁ + x₂y₂ + x₃y₃)².

Choose

    x₁ = √a,   y₁ = √a/(b+2c),
    x₂ = √b,   y₂ = √b/(c+2a),
    x₃ = √c,   y₃ = √c/(a+2b).

Then x₁y₁ + x₂y₂ + x₃y₃ = a/(b+2c) + b/(c+2a) + c/(a+2b) = S,

and

    x₁² + x₂² + x₃² = a + b + c,
    y₁² + y₂² + y₃² = a/(b+2c)² + b/(c+2a)² + c/(a+2b)².

However, a more direct version is obtained by pairing a/(b+2c) with the denominator factor b+2c.  Concretely, by the form

    (∑ a/(b+2c)) · (∑ a(b+2c)) ≥ (a + b + c)²,

we identify the second factor

    ∑ a(b+2c) = a(b+2c) + b(c+2a) + c(a+2b)
                    = ab + 2ac + bc + 2ab + ca + 2bc
                    = 3(ab + bc + ca).

Hence Cauchy–Schwarz gives

    S · 3(ab + bc + ca) ≥ (a + b + c)²,

so that

    S ≥ (a + b + c)² / [3(ab + bc + ca)].

Step 2: Reduce to a symmetric quadratic inequality

It now suffices to show

    (a + b + c)² / [3(ab + bc + ca)] ≥ 1

for all positive a, b, c.  Equivalently,

    (a + b + c)² ≥ 3(ab + bc + ca).

Expand the left-hand side:

    (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

Subtracting 3(ab + bc + ca) from both sides yields

    (a + b + c)² – 3(ab + bc + ca)
      = a² + b² + c² – (ab + bc + ca).

Thus the inequality is equivalent to

    a² + b² + c² ≥ ab + bc + ca.

Step 3: Verify the quadratic inequality by sum of squares

Observe that

    a² + b² + c² – (ab + bc + ca)
      = ½[(a–b)² + (b–c)² + (c–a)²],

and each square is nonnegative.  Therefore

    a² + b² + c² – (ab + bc + ca) ≥ 0,

with equality if and only if a = b = c.

Step 4: Conclude the bound and determine C

Combining the above results,

    S ≥ (a + b + c)² / [3(ab + bc + ca)] ≥ 1.

Hence the given expression S never falls below 1, and the weakest (largest) constant C that satisfies S ≥ C for all a, b, c > 0 is C = 1.  Moreover, equality S = 1 occurs exactly when a = b = c.

The answer is $C=1$
