## Problem
Let $a, b, c, d$ be non-negative real numbers. Consider the following inequality:
$$
a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4}+d^{4}+2 a b c d \quad () \quad a^{2} b^{2}+b^{2} c^{2}+c^{2} d^{2}+d^{2} a^{2}+a^{2} c^{2}+b^{2} d^{2} .
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
Without loss of generality we may assume that $a \geq b \geq c \geq d$.

Let us denote
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(a, b, c, d)= & a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4}+d^{4}+2 a b c d-a^{2} b^{2}-b^{2} c^{2}-c^{2} d^{2} \\
& -d^{2} a^{2}-a^{2} c^{2}-b^{2} d^{2} \\
= & a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4}+d^{4}+2 a b c d-a^{2} c^{2}-b^{2} d^{2}-\left(a^{2}+c^{2}\right)\left(b^{2}+d^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(a, b, c, d)-f(\sqrt{a c}, b, \sqrt{a c}, d) \\
&= a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4}+d^{4}+2 a b c d-a^{2} c^{2}-b^{2} d^{2}-\left(a^{2}+c^{2}\right)\left(b^{2}+d^{2}\right) \\
&-\left(a^{2} c^{2}+b^{4}+a^{2} c^{2}+d^{4}+2 a b c d-a^{2} c^{2}-b^{2} d^{2}-2 a c\left(b^{2}+d^{2}\right)\right) \\
&= a^{4}+c^{4}-2 a^{2} c^{2}-\left(b^{2}+d^{2}\right)\left(a^{2}+c^{2}+2 a c\right) \\
&=\left(a^{2}-c^{2}\right)^{2}-\left(b^{2}+d^{2}\right)(a-c)^{2}=(a-c)^{2}\left((a+c)^{2}-\left(b^{2}+d^{2}\right)\right) \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus
$$
f(a, b, c, d) \geq f(\sqrt{a c}, b, \sqrt{a c}, d)
$$

By the SMV theorem we only need to prove that $f(a, b, c, d) \geq 0$, in the case when $a=b=c=t \geq d$.

We have
$f(t, t, t, d) \geq 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 3 t^{4}+d^{4}+2 t^{3} d \geq 3 t^{4}+3 t^{2} d^{2} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad d^{4}+2 t^{3} d \geq 3 t^{2} d^{2}$, which immediately follows from $A M \geq G M$.

Equality occurs iff $a=b=c=d$ or $a=b=c, d=0$ (up to permutation). Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
Solution.

We wish to determine which relation “()” makes the following true for all non-negative real numbers a,b,c,d:

  a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 + 2abcd   ()   a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2d^2 + d^2a^2 + a^2c^2 + b^2d^2.

We will show that the correct sign is “≥.”  Our approach follows three main steps: (i) reduce by symmetry and ordering, (ii) apply a smoothing (or mixing-variables) argument, and (iii) verify the resulting two-variable case by AM–GM.

1. Symmetry, ordering, and the function f.

  (a) Observe that both sides of the inequality are symmetric in the variables a,b,c,d.  Hence, we may impose the ordering

    a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ d ≥ 0,

  without loss of generality.

  (b) Define the function

    f(a,b,c,d)
      = [a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 + 2abcd]
        −[a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2d^2 + d^2a^2 + a^2c^2 + b^2d^2].

  Clearly, the original inequality is equivalent to f(a,b,c,d) ≥ 0.

2. Smoothing (mixing-variables) on the pair (a,c).

  We claim that replacing (a,c) by the two equal numbers (√(ac),√(ac)) does not decrease the value of f.  Concretely, set

      x = √(ac),

  and consider the difference

      Δ = f(a,b,c,d) − f(x, b, x, d).

  A direct expansion gives:

    f(a,b,c,d)
      = a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 + 2abcd
        − [a^2c^2 + b^2d^2 + (a^2 + c^2)(b^2 + d^2)],

    f(x,b,x,d)
      = x^4 + b^4 + x^4 + d^4 + 2x^2bd
        − [x^4 + b^2d^2 + 2x^2(b^2 + d^2)]
      = 2x^4 + b^4 + d^4 + 2abcd
        − [x^4 + b^2d^2 + 2x^2(b^2 + d^2)],

  since x^2 = ac and x^4 = a^2c^2.  Subtracting, one finds after simplification:

    Δ = (a^2 − c^2)^2 − (b^2 + d^2)(a − c)^2
      = (a − c)^2[(a + c)^2 − (b^2 + d^2)].

  Under the assumed ordering a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ d, we have a + c ≥ b + d ≥ √(b^2 + d^2), so

      (a + c)^2 − (b^2 + d^2) ≥ 0,

  and hence Δ ≥ 0.  Therefore,

      f(a,b,c,d) ≥ f(√(ac), b, √(ac), d).

  By symmetry, one similarly shows that smoothing the pair (b,d) to (√(bd),√(bd)) also does not decrease f.

  By applying these two smoothing steps iteratively, we arrive at a quadruple of the form (t,t,t,d) with t = √(ac) = √(bd) and t ≥ d.  Since each step preserves the ordering f ≥ 0, it suffices to check the inequality f(t,t,t,d) ≥ 0.

3. Verification in the case a = b = c = t ≥ d.

  Substitute a = b = c = t and keep d arbitrary (0 ≤ d ≤ t).  Then

    f(t,t,t,d)
      = [3t^4 + d^4 + 2t·t·t·d]
        − [3t^4 + 3t^2d^2]
      = d^4 + 2t^3d − 3t^2d^2.

  We must show

      d^4 + 2t^3d ≥ 3t^2d^2.

  Apply the Arithmetic Mean–Geometric Mean inequality to the three nonnegative terms {d^4, t^3d, t^3d}:

      (d^4 + t^3d + t^3d)/3 ≥ (d^4 · t^3d · t^3d)^(1/3)
                             = (t^6d^6)^(1/3)
                             = t^2d^2.

  Hence d^4 + 2t^3d ≥ 3t^2d^2, as required.  Equality holds when d^4 = t^3d = t^3d, i.e. d = t, or when one of the terms is zero, i.e. d = 0 (t nonzero).  These correspond to the cases a = b = c = d or a = b = c > d = 0 (up to permutation).

Conclusion.

Since f(a,b,c,d) ≥ f(t,t,t,d) ≥ 0 for all nonnegative a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ d, we conclude

  a^4 + b^4 + c^4 + d^4 + 2abcd ≥ a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2d^2 + d^2a^2 + a^2c^2 + b^2d^2

for all nonnegative a,b,c,d.  Therefore, the desired relation is “≥.”

The answer is (B) ≥
