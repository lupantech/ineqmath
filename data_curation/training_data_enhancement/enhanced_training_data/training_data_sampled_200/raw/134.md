## Problem
Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. Find the smallest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$:
$$
\left(a^{2}+b+C\right)\left(b^{2}+a+C\right) \geq\left(2 a+1/2\right)\left(2 b+1/2\right)
$$

## Current Solution
For any $x \in \mathbb{R}$ we have $x^{2}+\frac{1}{4} \geq x$.
So it follows that
$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(a^{2}+b+\frac{3}{4}\right)\left(b^{2}+a+\frac{3}{4}\right) & \geq\left(a+b+\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(a+b+\frac{1}{2}\right)=\left(a+b+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2} \\
& =\left(\frac{2 a+2 b+1}{2}\right)^{2}=\left(\frac{2 a+\frac{1}{2}+2 b+\frac{1}{2}}{2}\right)^{2} \\
& \geq \geq G \\
& \geq\left(2 a+\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(2 b+\frac{1}{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Equality holds when $a = b = \frac{1}{2}$, since then $a^2 + b + \frac{3}{4} = (\frac{1}{2})^2 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{4} = 1.5$ and $2a + \frac{1}{2} = 1.5$, so both sides are equal. This gives the minimum value of $C$ for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \frac{3}{4}$.

## Expected Answer
$C = \frac{3}{4}$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to determine the smallest constant C such that for all positive real numbers a,b we have

    (a² + b + C) · (b² + a + C)  ≥  (2a + 1/2) · (2b + 1/2).

Our method is to propose C = 3/4 and then verify two inequalities:

1. Show that for each factor, a² + b + 3/4 ≥ a + b + 1/2 (and similarly with a↔b).
2. Show that (a + b + 1/2)² ≥ (2a + 1/2)(2b + 1/2).

Finally, we check that any smaller C fails the inequality when a = b = 1/2, so C = 3/4 is minimal.

Step 1 (A useful quadratic bound).
Claim. For every real x,

    x² + 1/4  ≥  x.

Proof. Rewrite x² + 1/4 − x = (x − 1/2)² ≥ 0.  Equality holds exactly when x = 1/2.

Step 2 (Lower‐bounding each factor).
Fix a,b > 0 and set C = 3/4.  Then

  a² + b + 3/4
  = (a² + 1/4) + (b + 1/2)
  ≥ a + (b + 1/2)
  = a + b + 1/2,

where we used the Claim with x = a.  Similarly,

  b² + a + 3/4  ≥ b + a + 1/2 = a + b + 1/2.

Therefore,

  (a² + b + 3/4)(b² + a + 3/4)
    ≥ (a + b + 1/2) · (a + b + 1/2)
    = (a + b + 1/2)².

Step 3 (Comparing with the right‐hand side).
We now compare (a + b + 1/2)² to (2a + 1/2)(2b + 1/2).  Expand both sides:

  (a + b + 1/2)²
    = a² + 2ab + b² + (a + b) + 1/4,

  (2a + 1/2)(2b + 1/2)
    = 4ab + a + b + 1/4.

Subtracting, we get

  (a + b + 1/2)² − (2a + 1/2)(2b + 1/2)
    = (a² + 2ab + b² + a + b + 1/4)
      − (4ab + a + b + 1/4)
    = a² − 2ab + b²
    = (a − b)² ≥ 0.

Hence

  (a + b + 1/2)²  ≥  (2a + 1/2)(2b + 1/2),

and chaining the inequalities shows

  (a² + b + 3/4)(b² + a + 3/4)
    ≥ (a + b + 1/2)²
    ≥ (2a + 1/2)(2b + 1/2)

for all a,b > 0.

Step 4 (Minimality of C = 3/4).
Suppose by way of contradiction that some C₀ < 3/4 also works.  Plugging in a = b = 1/2 into the left side gives

  ( (1/2)² + 1/2 + C₀ )² = (1/4 + 1/2 + C₀)² = (3/4 + C₀)².

But the right side at a = b = 1/2 is (2·½ + 1/2)² = (3/2)² = 9/4.  For the inequality to hold we need

  (3/4 + C₀)² ≥ 9/4,

which forces C₀ + 3/4 ≥ 3/2 and hence C₀ ≥ 3/4.  This contradicts C₀ < 3/4.  Thus no smaller constant works.

Conclusion.  The smallest constant C for which the given inequality holds for all positive a,b is 3/4.  

The answer is $C=3/4$
