## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be the side lengths of a given triangle. Find the minimal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the triangle inequality:
$$
(a+b-c)(b+c-a)(c+a-b) \leq C \cdot a b c
$$

## Current Solution
We have
$$
a^{2} \geq a^{2}-(b-c)^{2}=(a+b-c)(a+c-b)
$$

Analogously
$$
b^{2} \geq(b+a-c)(b+c-a) \quad \text { and } \quad c^{2} \geq(c+a-b)(c+b-a)
$$

If we multiply these inequalities we obtain
$$
\begin{aligned}
& a^{2} b^{2} c^{2} \geq(a+b-c)^{2}(b+c-a)^{2}(c+a-b)^{2} \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad a b c \geq(a+b-c)(b+c-a)(c+a-b)
\end{aligned}
$$

Equality holds if and only if $a = b = c$, i.e., the triangle is equilateral. In this case, $(a+b-c)(b+c-a)(c+a-b) = a^3$ and $abc = a^3$, so the inequality becomes equality. This gives the minimal value of $C$, which is $C = 1$.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 1$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 1$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

Let a, b, c be the side lengths of a triangle.  Our goal is to show that for all such triples \(a,b,c\),

\[ (a+b-c)\,(b+c-a)\,(c+a-b) \le C\,a\,b\,c, \]

and to determine the smallest constant \(C\) for which this inequality always holds.

1.  Positivity of the factors.  Since \(a,b,c\) are sides of a triangle, the usual triangle inequalities

\[ a < b + c, \quad b < c + a, \quad c < a + b \]

imply in particular

\[ a + b - c > 0, \quad b + c - a > 0, \quad c + a - b > 0. \]

Thus every factor on the left–hand side of the target inequality is strictly positive.

2.  Factorization via the difference of squares.  Observe the algebraic identity

\[ a^2 - (b - c)^2 = \bigl(a - (b-c)\bigr)\,\bigl(a + (b-c)\bigr) = (a + b - c)\,(a + c - b). \]

3.  Applying the triangle inequality.  From \(a < b + c\) we get \(a > |b - c|\), and hence

\[ a^2 - (b - c)^2 \;\ge\; 0 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad a^2 \ge (b - c)^2. \]

Combining this with the factorization in step 2 yields

\[ (a + b - c)\,(a + c - b) 
   = a^2 - (b - c)^2
   \le a^2. \]

4.  Cyclic analogues.  By exactly the same reasoning—interchanging the roles of \(a,b,c\)—we obtain

\[ (b + c - a)\,(b + a - c) \le b^2,
   \quad (c + a - b)\,(c + b - a) \le c^2. \]

5.  Multiplying the three inequalities.  Since all factors involved are positive, we may multiply the three estimates:

\[
(a + b - c)\,(a + c - b)
\;\times\;
(b + c - a)\,(b + a - c)
\;\times\;
(c + a - b)\,(c + b - a)
\;
\le\;
 a^2\,b^2\,c^2.
\]

Rearranging the left side shows that each of the six factors \((a+b-c),(b+c-a),(c+a-b)\) appears exactly twice, so

\[
\bigl[(a + b - c)\,(b + c - a)\,(c + a - b)\bigr]^2 \le a^2\,b^2\,c^2.
\]

6.  Taking positive square roots.  All factors are positive (from step 1), so we may safely take the positive square root of both sides and conclude

\[
(a + b - c)\,(b + c - a)\,(c + a - b)
\;\le\;
a\,b\,c.
\]

7.  Determination of the best constant and the case of equality.  The above shows the inequality holds with \(C = 1\).  To see that no smaller constant can work, observe that when \(a = b = c\) (the equilateral triangle) both sides become

\[ (a+a-a)^3 = a^3 \quad\text{and}\quad a\,a\,a = a^3, \]

so equality is attained.  Hence the minimal possible \(C\) is exactly 1.

Therefore, the answer is $C=1$
