## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be real numbers different from 1, such that $a+b+c=1$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{1+a^{2}}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1+b^{2}}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1+c^{2}}{1-c^{2}} \geq C
$$

## Current Solution
Since $a, b, c>0, a \neq 1, b \neq 1, c \neq 1$ and $a+b+c=1$ it follows that $0<a, b, c<1$.

The given inequality is symmetric, so without loss of generality we may assume that $a \leq b \leq c$.

Then we have
$$
1+a^{2} \leq 1+b^{2} \leq 1+c^{2} \quad \text { and } \quad 1-c^{2} \leq 1-b^{2} \leq 1-a^{2}
$$

Hence
$$
\frac{1}{1-a^{2}} \leq \frac{1}{1-b^{2}} \leq \frac{1}{1-c^{2}}
$$

Now by Chebishev's inequality we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
A & =\frac{1+a^{2}}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1+b^{2}}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1+c^{2}}{1-c^{2}} \\
& \geq \frac{1}{3}\left(1+a^{2}+1+b^{2}+1+c^{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-c^{2}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e.
$$
\begin{equation*}
A \geq \frac{\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+3\right)}{3}\left(\frac{1}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-c^{2}}\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Also we have the well-known inequality
$$
a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2} \geq \frac{(a+b+c)^{2}}{3}=\frac{1}{3}
$$

Therefore by (1) we obtain
$$
\begin{equation*}
A \geq \frac{(1 / 3+3)}{3}\left(\frac{1}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-c^{2}}\right)=\frac{10}{9}\left(\frac{1}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-c^{2}}\right) \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $1-a^{2}, 1-b^{2}, 1-c^{2}>0$, by using $A M \geq H M$ we deduce
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-c^{2}} \geq \frac{9}{3-\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\right)} \geq \frac{9}{3-1 / 3}=\frac{27}{8} \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

Finally from (2) and (3) we get
$$
A \geq \frac{10}{9}\left(\frac{1}{1-a^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-b^{2}}+\frac{1}{1-c^{2}}\right) \geq \frac{10}{9} \cdot \frac{27}{8}=\frac{15}{4}
$$
with equality iff $a=b=c=1 / 3$.

Equality is achieved when $a = b = c = \frac{1}{3}$, which satisfies $a + b + c = 1$ and $0 < a, b, c < 1$. In this case, the minimum value of the given expression is $\frac{15}{4}$, so $C = \frac{15}{4}$ is the largest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \frac{15}{4}$.

## Expected Answer
$C = \frac{15}{4}$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to show that for all real numbers a,b,c distinct from 1 and satisfying a + b + c = 1 (and in particular |a|,|b|,|c|<1 so that all denominators below are positive), the following holds:

    A := (1+a^2)/(1−a^2) + (1+b^2)/(1−b^2) + (1+c^2)/(1−c^2)  ≥  C,

and to determine the largest possible constant C.

Step 1.  Reduction to ordered variables and preparation for Chebyshev.
Since the expression A is symmetric in a,b,c, we may assume without loss of generality that

    a ≤ b ≤ c.

Then a^2 ≤ b^2 ≤ c^2, whence 1+a^2 ≤ 1+b^2 ≤ 1+c^2, and also 1−a^2 ≥ 1−b^2 ≥ 1−c^2.  Because all 1−a^2,1−b^2,1−c^2 are positive, taking reciprocals preserves the order: 

    1/(1−a^2) ≤ 1/(1−b^2) ≤ 1/(1−c^2).

Hence the two sequences

    X = (1+a^2, 1+b^2, 1+c^2)
    Y = (1/(1−a^2), 1/(1−b^2), 1/(1−c^2))

are both nondecreasing.  We are thus in the setting of Chebyshev’s inequality, which states that for two real sequences sorted in the same sense,

    (X1Y1 + X2Y2 + X3Y3)/3  ≥  ( (X1+X2+X3)/3 ) · ( (Y1+Y2+Y3)/3 ).

Applying Chebyshev with X_i = 1+a_i^2 and Y_i = 1/(1−a_i^2) gives

    A = Σ (1+a_i^2)/(1−a_i^2)
      = X1Y1 + X2Y2 + X3Y3
      ≥  3 · ( (X1+X2+X3)/3 ) · ( (Y1+Y2+Y3)/3 )
      =  (X1+X2+X3) · (Y1+Y2+Y3) / 3.

That is,

    A  ≥  ( (1+a^2) + (1+b^2) + (1+c^2) ) · ( 1/(1−a^2) + 1/(1−b^2) + 1/(1−c^2) )  /  3.

Step 2.  Lower bound for (1+a^2)+(1+b^2)+(1+c^2).
We compute

    (1+a^2)+(1+b^2)+(1+c^2)  =  3 + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2).

By the well-known inequality among three reals with fixed sum,

    a^2 + b^2 + c^2  ≥  (a+b+c)^2 / 3  =  1^2 / 3  =  1/3.

Hence

    3 + (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)  ≥  3 + 1/3  =  10/3.

Substituting into the Chebyshev estimate gives

    A  ≥  (10/3) · ( 1/(1−a^2) + 1/(1−b^2) + 1/(1−c^2) )  /  3
       =  (10/9) · ( 1/(1−a^2) + 1/(1−b^2) + 1/(1−c^2) ).

Step 3.  Lower bound for the sum of reciprocals via AM–HM.
For any three positive numbers u,v,w, the arithmetic mean is at least the harmonic mean:

    (u+v+w)/3  ≥  3 / (1/u + 1/v + 1/w),

or equivalently

    1/u + 1/v + 1/w  ≥  9 / (u + v + w).

Apply this with u = 1−a^2, v = 1−b^2, w = 1−c^2.  Then u+v+w = 3 − (a^2 + b^2 + c^2).  Since a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ≥ 1/3, we have

    u+v+w  =  3 − (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)  ≤  3 − 1/3  =  8/3.

Therefore

    1/(1−a^2) + 1/(1−b^2) + 1/(1−c^2)  ≥  9 / (u+v+w)
                                         ≥  9 / (8/3)
                                         =  27/8.

Step 4.  Combine the two bounds.
From Step 2 we have

    A  ≥  (10/9) · ( 1/(1−a^2) + 1/(1−b^2) + 1/(1−c^2) ),

and from Step 3 we have the sum of reciprocals ≥ 27/8.  Hence

    A  ≥  (10/9) · (27/8)  =  (10·27)/(9·8)  =  15/4.

Step 5.  Verification of equality case.
Equality in Chebyshev requires 1+a^2,1+b^2,1+c^2 and 1/(1−a^2), etc., to be proportional termwise, which forces a=b=c.  Equality in the estimate a^2+b^2+c^2 ≥ (a+b+c)^2/3 also forces a=b=c, and equality in AM–HM forces 1−a^2 = 1−b^2 = 1−c^2.  Together these give

    a = b = c  and  a + b + c = 1  ⇒  3a = 1  ⇒  a = 1/3,

and indeed A = 3·(1+(1/3)^2)/(1−(1/3)^2) = 3·(10/9)/(8/9) = 15/4 in this case.

We conclude that the inequality

    (1+a^2)/(1−a^2) + (1+b^2)/(1−b^2) + (1+c^2)/(1−c^2)  ≥  15/4

holds for all real a,b,c with a+b+c=1 and |a|,|b|,|c|<1, and that 15/4 is the largest constant for which it is valid.

The answer is $C=\frac{15}{4}$
