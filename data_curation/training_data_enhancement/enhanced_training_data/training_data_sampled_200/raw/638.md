## Problem
Let $a, b, c, d, e$ be positive real numbers such that $a+b+c+d+e=5$. Consider the following inequality:
$$
a b c + b c d + c d e + d e a + e a b \quad () \quad 5 .
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $e=\min \{a, b, c, d, e\}$.
By $A M \geq G M$, we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
a b c+b c d+c d e+d e a+e a b & =e(a+c)(b+d)+b c(a+d-e) \\
& \leq e\left(\frac{a+c+b+d}{2}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{b+c+a+d-e}{3}\right)^{3} \\
& =\frac{e(5-e)^{2}}{4}+\frac{(5-2 e)^{3}}{27}
\end{aligned}
$$

So it suffices to prove that
$$
\frac{e(5-e)^{2}}{4}+\frac{(5-2 e)^{3}}{27} \leq 5
$$
which can be rewrite as $(e-1)^{2}(e+8) \geq 0$, which is obviously true.
Equality holds if and only if $a=b=c=d=e=1$. Therefore, the answer is (A) $\leq$.

## Expected Answer
(A) $\leq$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to determine the correct inequality relation between
    S = a b c + b c d + c d e + d e a + e a b
and the constant 5, under the constraint
a + b + c + d + e = 5,
where a, b, c, d, e are positive real numbers.

Step 1.  Reduction by symmetry.  
Since the set {a,b,c,d,e} is symmetric in the expression S and in the condition a + b + c + d + e = 5, we may, without loss of generality, assume that e is the smallest of the five variables:
    e = min{a, b, c, d, e}.
This choice will simplify some ensuing inequalities.

Step 2.  Rewriting S in two grouped terms.  
Observe that we can group the five products as follows:
    S = a b c + b c d + c d e + d e a + e a b
      = e(a + c)(b + d)
        + b c (a + d – e).
To see this, note that expanding e(a + c)(b + d) gives
e·[ a b + a d + b c + c d ] = a b e + a d e + b c e + c d e,
and expanding b c(a + d – e) gives b c a + b c d – b c e.
Summing these two expansions yields exactly the five terms of S.

Step 3.  First AM–GM application.  
We estimate the first grouped term e(a + c)(b + d) by applying the Arithmetic Mean – Geometric Mean inequality (AM ≥ GM) to the two positive numbers (a + c) and (b + d):
    (a + c)(b + d)
      ≤ [ ( (a + c) + (b + d) ) / 2 ]^2
      = [ (a + b + c + d) / 2 ]^2.
Hence
    e(a + c)(b + d)
      ≤ e · [ (a + b + c + d) / 2 ]^2
      = e · [ (5 – e) / 2 ]^2
      = e (5 – e)^2 / 4,
where we used a + b + c + d = (a + b + c + d + e) – e = 5 – e.

Step 4.  Second AM–GM application.  
Next we estimate the second grouped term b c (a + d – e).  The four positive numbers b, c, a, (d – e) are not required in this step—instead, we directly apply AM–GM to the three positive numbers b, c, (a + d – e):
    b c (a + d – e)
      ≤ [ (b + c + (a + d – e)) / 3 ]^3
      = [ (a + b + c + d – e) / 3 ]^3
      = [ (5 – 2 e) / 3 ]^3,
where we used a + b + c + d – e = (a + b + c + d + e) – 2e = 5 – 2e.

Combining the two estimates, we obtain
    S ≤ e (5 – e)^2 / 4  +  (5 – 2e)^3 / 27.
It follows that in order to show S ≤ 5, it suffices to prove the single-variable inequality
    f(e) := e (5 – e)^2 / 4  +  (5 – 2e)^3 / 27  ≤ 5,
for e in the interval (0,1], since e ≤ the average (a + b + c + d + e)/5 = 1.

Step 5.  Verifying the single-variable inequality.  
We rearrange f(e) ≤ 5 algebraically.  Multiply both sides by the common denominator 108 = lcm(4,27):
    108 · f(e) ≤ 108 · 5 = 540.
Explicitly,
    108·[ e(5 – e)^2 / 4 ] + 108·[ (5 – 2e)^3 / 27 ]  ≤ 540
⇔ 27 e (5 – e)^2 + 4 (5 – 2e)^3  ≤ 540.
Expanding and simplifying the left–hand side yields a polynomial in e whose difference from 540 factors neatly.  One finds equivalently
    (e – 1)^2 (e + 8)  ≥ 0.
Since e > 0, we have e + 8 > 8 > 0, and of course (e – 1)^2 ≥ 0 for all real e.  Therefore the product (e – 1)^2 (e + 8) is nonnegative, establishing that f(e) ≤ 5.

Step 6.  Conclusion and equality case.  
Combining the above steps shows that
    S ≤ e (5 – e)^2 / 4  +  (5 – 2e)^3 / 27  ≤ 5.
Hence
    a b c + b c d + c d e + d e a + e a b  ≤ 5.
Moreover, equality throughout occurs precisely when all the AM–GM estimates are equalities.  These require
    (a + c) = (b + d),
    b = c = a + d – e,
and also e = 1 (since (e – 1)^2 = 0).  Together with a + b + c + d + e = 5, one deduces a = b = c = d = e = 1.

Therefore the correct inequality relation is “≤.”

The answer is (A) ≤
