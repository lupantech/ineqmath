Once this minimum S_{\\min} is found, we will have C = S_{\\min}.\n\nStep 1: Apply the AM–GM inequality to the numbers a_{1},a_{2},\\dots,a_{n}.\n\n  By the Arithmetic–Geometric Mean inequality (AM–GM), for positive reals a_{i},\n\n    (a_{1}a_{2}\\cdots a_{n})^{1/n} \\;\\le\\; \\frac{a_{1} + a_{2} + \\cdots + a_{n}}{n}\n\n  Since a_{1} + a_{2} + \\cdots + a_{n} = 1,\n\n    (a_{1}a_{2}\\cdots a_{n})^{1/n} \\le \\frac{1}{n}.\n\n  Raising both sides to the n-th power gives\n\n    a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{n} \\le n^{-n}\n\n  and hence\n\n    (a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{n})^{-1} \\ge n^{n}.\n\nStep 2: Relate the product bound to the sum S using AM–GM on the terms a_{i}^{-k}.\n\n  Consider the n nonnegative numbers a_{1}^{-k},a_{2}^{-k},\\dots,a_{n}^{-k}.

In the first application, equality requires\n\n    a_{1} = a_{2} = \\cdots = a_{n},\n\n  and since their sum is 1, each a_{i} must be 1/n.  Substituting a_{i}=1/n into each a_{i}^{-k} gives (1/n)^{-k}=n^{k}, so the sum is n\\cdot n^{k}=n^{k+1}.  Thus n^{k+1} is indeed the minimum possible value of S, and no larger constant C can work for all choices of the a_{i}.\n\nConclusion: The minimal value of\n\n  a_{1}^{-k} + a_{2}^{-k} + \\cdots + a_{n}^{-k}\n\nunder the condition a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n}=1 is n^{k+1}, hence the maximal constant C for which the original inequality holds identically is\n\nThe answer is $C = n^{k+1}$",
