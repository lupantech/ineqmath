$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{a^{2}+b^{2}}{a+b}+\frac{b^{2}+c^{2}}{b+c}+\frac{c^{2}+a^{2}}{c+a} \\
& \quad=\frac{a^{2}}{a+b}+\frac{b^{2}}{b+c}+\frac{c^{2}}{c+a}+\frac{b^{2}}{a+b}+\frac{c^{2}}{b+c}+\frac{a^{2}}{c+a} \\
& \geq \frac{(2(a+b+c))^{2}}{4(a+b+c)}=a+b+c
\end{aligned}
$$ Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We want to determine the correct relation between
  S = \frac{a^{2}+b^{2}}{a+b} + \frac{b^{2}+c^{2}}{b+c} + \frac{c^{2}+a^{2}}{c+a}
and
  T = a + b + c,
where a, b, c are positive real numbers.

Step 1: Decompose each term.
Observe that for any positive a, b,
  \frac{a^{2} + b^{2}}{a + b}
  = \frac{a^{2}}{a + b} + \frac{b^{2}}{a + b}.
Applying this decomposition cyclically gives six positive summands:

  S  = \frac{a^{2}}{a + b} + \frac{b^{2}}{b + c} + \frac{c^{2}}{c + a}
     + \frac{b^{2}}{a + b} + \frac{c^{2}}{b + c} + \frac{a^{2}}{c + a}.

Step 2: Prepare to apply the Engel (Titu) lemma.
Since all denominators a + b, b + c, c + a are positive, we may use the inequality
  \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_i^2}{y_i}
    \ge \frac{(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i},
valid for any real x_i and positive y_i.

Here we identify our six terms as follows:
  Term 1: x_1 = a,  y_1 = a + b
  Term 2: x_2 = b,  y_2 = b + c
  Term 3: x_3 = c,  y_3 = c + a
  Term 4: x_4 = b,  y_4 = a + b
  Term 5: x_5 = c,  y_5 = b + c
  Term 6: x_6 = a,  y_6 = c + a

Compute the sums:
  \sum_{i=1}^{6} x_i = a + b + c + b + c + a = 2(a + b + c),
  \sum_{i=1}^{6} y_i = 2\bigl[(a+b)+(b+c)+(c+a)\bigr] = 4(a + b + c).

By the Engel lemma,
  S = \sum_{i=1}^{6} \frac{x_i^2}{y_i}
    \ge \frac{\bigl(2(a + b + c)\bigr)^2}{4(a + b + c)}
    = \frac{4(a + b + c)^2}{4(a + b + c)}
    = a + b + c.

Thus we have shown
  S \ge a + b + c.

Step 3: Conclusion and equality case.
The derived inequality is
  \frac{a^{2}+b^{2}}{a+b} + \frac{b^{2}+c^{2}}{b+c} + \frac{c^{2}+a^{2}}{c+a}
    \ge a + b + c.
Equality in the Engel lemma occurs precisely when all ratios x_i/y_i are equal, which here forces
a = b = c.  Hence the inequality is sharp and attained exactly at a = b = c.

Therefore, the correct relation is “\ge”.

The answer is (B) ≥
