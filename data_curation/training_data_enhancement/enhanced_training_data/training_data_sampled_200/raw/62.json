The original solution introduces a convenient parametrization that automatically enforces abcd=1, then applies the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to obtain the desired bound.  We now give a more detailed, step-by-step justification of each passage, while preserving the original approach and final value C=2.\n\n1.  Substitution to encode the constraint abcd=1\n------------------------------------------------\n\n   Since a,b,c,d>0 and abcd=1, we may set\n\n       a = x/y,\n       b = t/x,\n       c = z/t,\n       d = y/z,\n\n   where x,y,z,t are arbitrary positive real numbers.  Indeed, then\n\n       a·b·c·d = (x/y)·(t/x)·(z/t)·(y/z) = 1.\n\n   Under this change of variables, each of the four summands becomes a simple fraction in x,y,z,t.  We compute them one by one:\n\n   •  The first term:\n\n        1/[a(1+b)]  =  1/[ (x/y)·(1 + t/x ) ]\n                   =  1/[ (x+y? no)  \\raise0.5ex\\hbox{(} (x/y)·(x+t)/x ) ]\n                   =  1/[ (x+t)/y ]\n                   =  y/(x+t).\n\n   •  The second term:\n\n        1/[b(1+c)]  =  1/[ (t/x)·(1 + z/t ) ] = 1/[ (t+z)/x ] = x/(t+z).\n\n   •  The third term:\n\n        1/[c(1+d)]  =  1/[ (z/t)·(1 + y/z ) ] = 1/[ (z+y)/t ] = t/(z+y).\n\n   •  The fourth term:\n\n        1/[d(1+a)]  =  1/[ (y/z)·(1 + x/y ) ] = 1/[ (y+x)/z ] = z/(x+y).\n\n   Hence the original sum becomes\n\n       S  =  y/(x+t)  +  x/(t+z)  +  t/(z+y)  +  z/(x+y).\n\n   For symmetry of presentation, one may reorder the four terms arbitrarily; for definiteness we keep this order.\n\n2.  Application of the Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality\n------------------------------------------------\n\n   We now show that S ≥ 2 for all positive x,y,z,t.  Observe that each term is a fraction of the form u/(v+w).  To apply Cauchy–Schwarz in the following classical form,\n\n       \\sum_{i=1}^n  u_i^2/v_i  ≥  (\\sum_{i=1}^n u_i)^2  /  (\\sum_{i=1}^n v_i),\n\n   we rewrite each fraction u/(v+w) as u^2/[u(v+w)].  Concretely,\n\n       y/(x+t) = y^2/[ y(x+t) ],\n       x/(t+z) = x^2/[ x(t+z) ],\n       t/(z+y) = t^2/[ t(z+y) ],\n       z/(x+y) = z^2/[ z(x+y) ].\n\n   Set in the inequality above:\n\n       u_1 = y,   v_1 = y(x+t),\n       u_2 = x,   v_2 = x(t+z),\n       u_3 = t,   v_3 = t(z+y),\n       u_4 = z,   v_4 = z(x+y).\n\n   Then\n\n       S = \\sum_{i=1}^4  u_i^2/v_i\n         ≥ (y + x + t + z)^2  /  [ y(x+t) + x(t+z) + t(z+y) + z(x+y) ].\n\n   We simplify the denominator:\n\n       y(x+t) + x(t+z) + t(z+y) + z(x+y)\n       = yx + yt + xt + xz + tz + ty + zx + zy\n       = (yx + xy) + (yt + ty) + (xz + zx) + (tz + zt)\n       = 2xy + 2yt + 2xz + 2zt\n       = 2(xy + xt + yz + zt)  [noting each pair].\n\n   As a result,\n\n       S  ≥  (x + y + z + t)^2  /  [ 2(xy + xt + yz + zt) ].\n\n3.  Reduction to a sum of squares\n----------------------------------\n\n   We must now prove\n\n       (x + y + z + t)^2  /  [ 2(xy + xt + yz + zt) ]  ≥  2,\n\n   or equivalently,\n\n       (x + y + z + t)^2  ≥  2 · 2(xy + xt + yz + zt)\n       ↔  (x + y + z + t)^2  ≥  4(xy + xt + yz + zt).\n\n   Expand the left-hand side:\n\n       (x + y + z + t)^2\n       = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2\n         + 2(xy + xz + xt + yz + yt + zt).\n\n   Therefore,\n\n       (x + y + z + t)^2  -  4(xy + xt + yz + zt)\n       = [x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2]\n         + 2(xy + xz + xt + yz + yt + zt)\n         - 4(xy + xt + yz + zt)\n       = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2\n         - 2(xz + yt)\n         + 2(xy + xt + yz + zt) - 2(xy + xt + yz + zt)\n       = (x^2 - 2xz + z^2)  +  (y^2 - 2yt + t^2)\n       = (x - z)^2  +  (y - t)^2  ≥ 0.\n\n   Since both squares are nonnegative for all real x,z and y,t, the inequality holds universally.  Hence\n\n       S  ≥  2.\n\n4.  Determination of the best constant C and equality case\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n   We have shown that for every choice of positive x,y,z,t (hence every a,b,c,d with abcd=1), the original sum is at least 2.  Thus we can take C=2.  To see that no larger C would work, we exhibit the equality case.  The above chain of inequalities becomes an equality precisely when each of the following holds simultaneously:\n\n   •  In the Cauchy–Schwarz step, equality requires the four ratios u_i^2/v_i to be proportional to u_i, which here forces all of v_i/u_i to be equal.  Concretely one finds that x/(t+z) = y/(x+t) = z/(x+y) = t/(z+y).  Equivalently, x=z and y=t.\n\n   •  In the final reduction to squares, equality occurs when x=z and y=t.  \n\n   Thus equality happens exactly when x=z and y=t.  Translating back to a,b,c,d,\n\n       a = x/y,\n       b = t/x = y/x = 1/a,\n       c = z/t = x/y = a,\n       d = y/z = y/x = 1/a.\n\n   In that symmetric configuration one checks directly that the original sum equals 2, so no improvement on C=2 is possible.\n\nConclusion:\n-----------\nThe largest constant C for which the inequality\n\n    1/[a(1+b)] + 1/[b(1+c)] + 1/[c(1+d)] + 1/[d(1+a)] ≥ C\n\nholds under the constraint abcd=1 is\n\nThe answer is $C=2$.",
