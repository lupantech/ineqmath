## Problem
Let $a, b, c, d > 0$ be real numbers. Let $u = ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd$ and $v = abc + abd + acd + bcd$. Find the maximal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c, d > 0$:
$$
2u^3 \geq Cv^2
$$

## Current Solution
We have $p_{2}=\frac{u}{\binom{4}{2}}=\frac{u}{6}$ and $p_{3}=\frac{v}{\binom{4}{3}}=\frac{v}{4}$.
By Maclaurin's inequality we have
$$
p_{2}^{\frac{1}{2}} \geq p_{3}^{\frac{1}{3}} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad p_{2}^{3} \geq p_{3}^{2} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad\left(\frac{u}{6}\right)^{3} \geq\left(\frac{v}{4}\right)^{2} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 2 u^{3} \geq 27 v^{2}
$$

Equality holds when $a = b = c = d$, that is, all variables are equal. In this case, the inequality becomes an equality, and $C = 27$ is the maximal value for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 27$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 27$

Enhanced Solution:

1. Introduction and Notation
   
   We are given four positive real numbers a, b, c, d > 0, and we define the following symmetric sums:
   
   • u = ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd, the sum of all pairwise products.
   • v = abc + abd + acd + bcd, the sum of all triple products.
   
   Our goal is to find the largest constant C such that the inequality
   
       2 u³ ≥ C v²
   
   holds for all positive a, b, c, d.

2. Elementary Symmetric Means and Maclaurin’s Inequality

   Let σ₂ and σ₃ denote the elementary symmetric sums of degree 2 and 3, so that
      σ₂ = u  and  σ₃ = v.

   Define the power means (or rather the elementary symmetric means) p₂ and p₃ by averaging over the number of terms:

      p₂ = σ₂ / (number of 2‐element subsets of {a,b,c,d}) = u / 6,
      p₃ = σ₃ / (number of 3‐element subsets of {a,b,c,d}) = v / 4.

   Maclaurin’s inequality states that for a set of n positive numbers, the sequence of quantities

      p_k = (σ_k) / (C(n, k))

   is decreasing in k when passed through the appropriate root, i.e.

      p₂^(1/2) ≥ p₃^(1/3)  for n = 4,   k = 2, 3.

3. Applying Maclaurin’s Inequality

   From p₂^(1/2) ≥ p₃^(1/3), we raise both sides to the 6th power (the least common multiple of 2 and 3) to eliminate the fractional exponents:

      (p₂^(1/2))^6 ≥ (p₃^(1/3))^6
      ⟹ p₂³ ≥ p₃².

   Substituting p₂ = u/6 and p₃ = v/4 gives:

      (u/6)³ ≥ (v/4)²
      ⟹ u³ / 6³ ≥ v² / 4²
      ⟹ u³ / 216 ≥ v² / 16
      ⟹ 16 u³ ≥ 216 v²
      ⟹ 2 u³ ≥ 27 v².

   Thus we obtain the inequality in the desired form, with C = 27:

      2 u³ ≥ 27 v².

4. Sharpness and Equality Case

   Maclaurin’s inequality attains equality precisely when all the variables are equal.  In our setting, equality occurs if and only if

      a = b = c = d.

   Substituting a = b = c = d into u and v:

      u = 6 a²,   v = 4 a³,

   and verifying the relation:

      2 (6 a²)³ = 2 · 216 a⁶ = 432 a⁶,
      27 (4 a³)² = 27 · 16 a⁶ = 432 a⁶.

   Hence equality holds, confirming that C = 27 is the largest possible constant.

5. Conclusion

   We have shown by a direct application of Maclaurin’s inequality that for all positive a, b, c, d,

      2 u³ ≥ 27 v²,

   and that 27 is the maximal constant for which this inequality remains valid.  

The answer is $C=27$
