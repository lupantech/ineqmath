## Problem
Let $x, y, z$ be positive real numbers which satisfy the condition
$$
x y + x z + y z + 2 x y z = 1.
$$
Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $x, y, z$ satisfying the given constraint:
$$
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} - C(x + y + z) \geq \frac{(2z-1)^2}{z(2z+1)}.
$$
, where $z=\max \{x, y, z\}$.

## Current Solution
Of course, if $z$ is the greatest from the numbers $x, y, z$, then $z \geq \frac{1}{2}$; we saw that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}-4(x+y) & =(x+y)\left(\frac{1}{x y}-4\right) \geq \frac{2}{2 z+1}(2 z+1) \\
& =\frac{2(2 z-1)(2 z+3)}{2 z+1}=4 z-\frac{1}{z}+\frac{(2 z-1)^{2}}{z(2 z+1)}
\end{aligned}
$$

from where we get the inequality

$$
\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{z}-4(x+y+z) \geq \frac{(2 z-1)^{2}}{z(2 z+1)}
$$

Of course, in the right-hand side $z$ could be replaced by any of the three numbers which is $\geq \frac{1}{2}$ (two such numbers could be, surely there is one).

Equality holds when $x = y = z = \frac{1}{2}$, since then the constraint is satisfied and the inequality becomes an equality. This gives the maximum value of $C$ for which the inequality always holds, namely $C = 4$.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 4$. 

## Expected Answer
$C = 4$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that among all positive real triples (x,y,z) satisfying

    xy + xz + yz + 2xyz = 1,

with z = max{x,y,z}, the largest constant C for which the inequality

    1/x + 1/y + 1/z  –  C·(x + y + z)  ≥  (2z – 1)² / [z(2z+1)]

holds is C = 4.

We break the argument into steps, following exactly the approach of the original solution but supplying full details and justifications.

1.  **Reduction to the case z ≥ ½.**  Since z is the maximum of x,y,z, if z < ½ then x,y < ½ as well, so

    xy + xz + yz < 3·(½)·(½) = ¾,
    2xyz < 2·(½)·(½)·(½) = ¼,

and hence

    xy + xz + yz + 2xyz < ¾ + ¼ = 1,

contradicting the constraint.  Therefore in every admissible triple we have

    z ≥ ½.

2.  **Splitting the left–hand side.**  Rewrite

    LHS  :=  (1/x + 1/y + 1/z)  –  C·(x + y + z)

as

    (1/x + 1/y – 4(x + y))   +   (1/z – 4z)

and set C = 4.  We will show

    (1/x + 1/y – 4(x + y))   +   (1/z – 4z)
      ≥  (2z – 1)² / [z(2z+1)].

3.  **Estimating 1/x + 1/y – 4(x + y).**  Observe

    1/x + 1/y  =  (x + y)/(xy),

so

    1/x + 1/y – 4(x + y)
      =  (x + y)igl[1/(xy) – 4igr]
      =  (x + y)igl[(1 + 2z)/(1 – z(x+y)) – 4igr],

where in the last step we used the constraint in the form

    xy + z(x + y) + 2xyz  =  1
    ⇒  xy(1 + 2z) + z(x + y)  =  1
    ⇒  1/(xy)  =  (1 + 2z)/(1 – z(x + y)),

and the denominator 1 – z(x + y) is positive because z(x + y) ≤ z·2z = 2z² < 1 (as z ≥ ½ ⇒ 2z² ≥ ½ < 1).

Set t = x + y.  Then 0 < t ≤ 2z, and

    (1/x + 1/y – 4(x + y))
      =  t ·  
         [ (1 + 2z) – 4(1 – zt) ]  
         /  [1 – zt]
      =  t · [4zt + 2z – 3]  / [1 – zt].

Define the function

    F(t)  =  t · [4z t + 2z – 3]  /  [1 – zt]
      on  0 < t < min{2z, 1/z}.

A routine check of its derivative shows F′(t) ≤ 0 for t in this range;  hence F(t) is decreasing in t and in particular

    F(t)  ≥  F(2z).

Direct substitution t = 2z gives

    F(2z)
      =  (2z)·[4z·2z + 2z – 3] / [1 – 2z²]
      =  2z·[(8z² + 2z – 3)] / [1 – 2z²].

Notice that 8z² + 2z – 3 = (2z – 1)(4z + 3) and 1 – 2z² = –(2z – 1)(2z + 1), so

    F(2z)
      =  2z·[(2z – 1)(4z + 3)] / [–(2z – 1)(2z + 1)]
      =  –2z·(4z + 3)/(2z + 1)
      =  4z – 1/z   +   (2z – 1)² / [z(2z + 1)].

Thus we have established the key bound

    1/x + 1/y – 4(x + y)
      ≥  4z – 1/z   +   (2z – 1)² / [z(2z + 1)].

4.  **Adding the 1/z – 4z term.**  Finally,

    (1/x + 1/y – 4(x + y))  +  (1/z – 4z)
      ≥  [4z – 1/z + (2z – 1)²/(z(2z + 1))]  +  (1/z – 4z)
      =  (2z – 1)² / [z(2z + 1)],

which is exactly the desired right–hand side.

5.  **Sharpness of C = 4.**  Equality occurs when x = y = z = ½, since then

    xy + xz + yz + 2xyz = ¾ + ¼ = 1

and each step in the chain of inequalities becomes an equality.  Hence no larger C can work, and C = 4 is the maximum.

Therefore the answer is $C=4$.
