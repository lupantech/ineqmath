## Problem
Prove that for any real numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$, there exists a constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds:
$$
\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}\right)^{2} \leq C \sum_{i, j=1}^{n} a_{i} a_{j}
$$
Determine the minimal value of $C$.

## Current Solution
Observe that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{i, j=1}^{n} \frac{i j}{i+j-1} a_{i} a_{j} & =\sum_{i, j=1}^{n} i a_{i} \cdot j a_{j} \int_{0}^{1} t^{i+j-2} d t= \\
& =\int_{0}^{1}\left(\sum_{i, j=1}^{n} i a_{i} \cdot j a_{j} \cdot t^{i-1+j-1}\right) d t= \\
& =\int_{0}^{1}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i a_{i} \cdot t^{i-1}\right)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, using the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality for integrals, we get

$$
\int_{0}^{1}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i a_{i} \cdot t^{i-1}\right)^{2} d t \geq\left(\int_{0}^{1}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i a_{i} \cdot t^{i-1}\right) d t\right)^{2}=\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}\right)^{2}
$$

which ends the proof.

Equality in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for integrals holds when the function $\sum_{i=1}^n i a_i t^{i-1}$ is constant in $t$ on $[0,1]$, which occurs only when all $a_i = 0$ except possibly $a_1$. Thus, the minimal value of $C$ is $C = \frac{ij}{i+j-1}$.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \frac{ij}{i+j-1}$. 

## Expected Answer
$C = \frac{ij}{i+j-1}$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to show that for any real numbers a_{1},a_{2},…,a_{n} there is a constant C (depending only on n) such that

    (∑_{i=1}^n a_i)^2  ≤  C · ∑_{i,j=1}^n a_i a_j.

Moreover, we shall identify the smallest possible such C.

1.  Rewriting the right–hand side via an integral kernel.  
Define for i,j=1,…,n the numbers K_{ij} = (i j)/(i+j−1).  Observe that, by the Beta‐integral identity,

    K_{ij}  =  ∫_{0}^{1} i t^{i−1} · j t^{j−1}  dt.

Hence for any choice of real a_{1},…,a_{n} we have

    ∑_{i,j=1}^n K_{ij}\,a_i a_j
      =  ∑_{i,j=1}^n a_i a_j  ∫_{0}^{1} i t^{i−1}·j t^{j−1} dt
      =  ∫_{0}^{1}  ∑_{i,j=1}^n (i a_i t^{i−1}) (j a_j t^{j−1})  dt
      =  ∫_{0}^{1}  ( ∑_{i=1}^n i a_i t^{i−1} )^2  dt.

Thus the given quadratic form on the right–hand side can be realized as the L^2‐norm (squared) of the function

    f(t)  =  ∑_{i=1}^n i a_i t^{i−1},    t∈[0,1].

2.  Application of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality for integrals.  
On the interval [0,1], the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality yields

    ∫_{0}^{1} [f(t)]^2 dt  ≥  ( ∫_{0}^{1} f(t)\,dt )^2.

But by term–by–term integration,

    ∫_{0}^{1} f(t)\,dt
      =  ∫_{0}^{1} ∑_{i=1}^n i a_i t^{i−1} dt
      =  ∑_{i=1}^n i a_i  ∫_{0}^{1} t^{i−1} dt
      =  ∑_{i=1}^n i a_i · (1/i)
      =  ∑_{i=1}^n a_i.

Combining these gives

    ∑_{i,j=1}^n K_{ij}\,a_i a_j
      =  ∫_{0}^{1} [f(t)]^2 dt
      ≥  ( ∑_{i=1}^n a_i )^2.

Hence for every vector (a_{1},…,a_{n}) we have

    (∑_{i=1}^n a_i)^2  ≤  ∑_{i,j=1}^n K_{ij}\,a_i a_j.

3.  Identifying the minimal constant.  
The inequality we have obtained shows that it suffices to choose

    C  ≥  max_{1≤i,j≤n} K_{ij}  =  max_{1≤i,j≤n}  ( i j )/(i+j−1).

On the other hand, if C were any smaller than this maximum entry, one could choose a vector a having a single nonzero coordinate in the position (i,j) attaining the maximum, and the desired inequality would fail.  Therefore the smallest admissible constant C is exactly

    max_{1≤i,j≤n}  i j  ⁄  (i + j – 1).

Thus the bound holds for this choice of C, and no smaller C can work for all real (a_{1},…,a_{n}).

Final Answer:
The answer is $C=\frac{ij}{i+j-1}$
