## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers. Find the maximal positive number $C$ such that the inequality below holds for all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$:
$$
\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}}{a+b}+\frac{b^{2}+c^{2}}{b+c}+\frac{c^{2}+a^{2}}{c+a} \geq C(a+b+c)
$$

## Current Solution
By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{a^{2}+b^{2}}{a+b}+\frac{b^{2}+c^{2}}{b+c}+\frac{c^{2}+a^{2}}{c+a} \\
& \quad=\frac{a^{2}}{a+b}+\frac{b^{2}}{b+c}+\frac{c^{2}}{c+a}+\frac{b^{2}}{a+b}+\frac{c^{2}}{b+c}+\frac{a^{2}}{c+a} \\
& \geq \frac{(2(a+b+c))^{2}}{4(a+b+c)}=a+b+c
\end{aligned}
$$

Equality holds when $a = b = c$, in which case both sides are equal. This gives the minimum value of the expression, so the maximal value of $C$ is $1$.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 1$. 

## Expected Answer
$C = 1$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that for all positive real numbers a,b,c the following inequality holds and to determine the largest constant C for which it is valid:  
  
  (⋆)   (a² + b²)/(a + b) + (b² + c²)/(b + c) + (c² + a²)/(c + a)   ≥   C (a + b + c).  
  
Step 1.  Rewrite the left–hand side as a sum of six simpler fractions.  Observe that  
  (a² + b²)/(a + b)   =   a²/(a + b)   +   b²/(a + b),  
and similarly for the other two terms.  Hence  
  LHS  =  a²/(a + b) + b²/(a + b)  
         + b²/(b + c) + c²/(b + c)  
         + c²/(c + a) + a²/(c + a).  
  
Step 2.  Apply the Cauchy–Schwarz (Titu’s) lemma in the form  
  ∑_{i=1}^n u_i²/v_i  ≥  (∑_{i=1}^n u_i)² / (∑_{i=1}^n v_i),  
valid whenever each v_i>0.  We choose n=6 and set  
  u₁ = a,  v₁ = a + b;    u₂ = b,  v₂ = b + c;    u₃ = c,  v₃ = c + a;  
  u₄ = b,  v₄ = a + b;    u₅ = c,  v₅ = b + c;    u₆ = a,  v₆ = c + a.  
Then  
  ∑_{i=1}^6 u_i²/v_i  =  a²/(a+b) + b²/(b+c) + c²/(c+a)  
                        + b²/(a+b) + c²/(b+c) + a²/(c+a)  
                      =  LHS.  
Moreover,  
  ∑_{i=1}^6 u_i  =  (a + b + c) + (a + b + c)  =  2(a + b + c),  
  ∑_{i=1}^6 v_i  =  2[(a + b) + (b + c) + (c + a)]  =  4(a + b + c).  
By Cauchy–Schwarz,  
  LHS  ≥  [2(a + b + c)]² / [4(a + b + c)]  =  4(a + b + c)² / [4(a + b + c)]  =  a + b + c.  
  
Step 3.  Conclude the inequality.  We have shown  
  (a² + b²)/(a + b) + (b² + c²)/(b + c) + (c² + a²)/(c + a)  ≥  a + b + c.  
Comparing with (⋆), this proves the original inequality with C=1.  
  
Step 4.  Check the equality case.  Equality in the Cauchy–Schwarz step occurs precisely when the six ratios u_i/v_i are all equal.  That condition forces a = b = c, which indeed makes both sides of (⋆) equal to 2a for each term and totals 3⋅(2a)/2 = 3a on the left and 1⋅3a on the right.  
  
Therefore the largest constant C for which the inequality holds for all positive a,b,c is C=1.  
  
The answer is $C=1$.
