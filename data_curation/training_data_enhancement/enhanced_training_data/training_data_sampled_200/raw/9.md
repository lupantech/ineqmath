## Problem
Let $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. Find the largest constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$:
$$
a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4} \geq C \cdot a b c (a+b+c)
$$

## Current Solution
We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
a^{4} & +b^{4}+c^{4} \geq a b c(a+b+c) \\
& \Leftrightarrow \quad a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4} \geq a^{2} b c+b^{2} a c+c^{2} a b \\
& \Leftrightarrow \quad \frac{T[4,0,0]}{2} \geq \frac{T[2,1,1]}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e.
$$
T[4,0,0] \geq T[2,1,1]
$$
which is true according to Muirhead's theorem.

Equality holds when $a = b = c$, since then both sides are equal: $a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = 3a^4$ and $abc(a+b+c) = a^3 \cdot 3a = 3a^4$. This gives the minimum value of the left side, so $C = 1$ is the largest constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 1$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 1$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

1. Restating the problem.  We wish to determine the largest real constant C such that for all positive real numbers a,b,c the inequality

    a^4 + b^4 + c^4  ≥  C · a b c (a + b + c)

holds.

2. Symmetric‐sum notation.  Define the following symmetric sums over variables a,b,c:

   •  S_{4,0,0} :=  a^4 + b^4 + c^4,
   •  S_{2,1,1} :=  a^2 b c + a b^2 c + a b c^2.

Then the inequality to prove becomes

   S_{4,0,0}  ≥  C · S_{2,1,1}.

3. Determining the optimal constant.  
   (a)  First, we show that C=1 works.  We must prove for all a,b,c>0:

       a^4 + b^4 + c^4  ≥  1 · (a^2 b c + a b^2 c + a b c^2),

       i.e.  S_{4,0,0}  ≥  S_{2,1,1}.

   (b)  Application of Muirhead’s inequality.  Observe the exponent 3‐tuples:

       (4,0,0)  and  (2,1,1).

       Since (4,0,0) majorizes (2,1,1)—because 4 ≥ 2, and 4+0 ≥ 2+1—Muirhead’s theorem implies

       S_{4,0,0}  ≥  S_{2,1,1}

       for all positive a,b,c.  Hence the inequality holds with C=1.

4. Sharpness of the constant.  To see that no larger C>1 can work, consider the special case a=b=c=t>0.  Then

   LHS  =  t^4 + t^4 + t^4  =  3 t^4,
   RHS  =  C · [t·t·t·(t+t+t)]  =  C · (t^3 · 3t)  =  3 C t^4.

   The inequality 3 t^4 ≥ 3 C t^4 holds for all t>0 if and only if C ≤ 1.  Thus C=1 is the largest possible constant.

5. Conclusion.  The optimal constant is

   The answer is $C=1$
