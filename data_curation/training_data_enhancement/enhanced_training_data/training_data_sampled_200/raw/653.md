## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be the lengths of the sides of a triangle. Consider the following condition:
$$
2\left(a b^{2}+b c^{2}+c a^{2}\right)=a^{2} b+b^{2} c+c^{2} a+3 a b c.
$$
Determine the correct relation between $a$, $b$, and $c$ to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
We'll show that
$$
a^{2} b+b^{2} c+c^{2} a+3 a b c \geq 2\left(a b^{2}+b c^{2}+c a^{2}\right)
$$
with equality if and only if $a=b=c$, i.e. the triangle is equilateral.
Let us use Ravi's substitutions, i.e. $a=x+y, b=y+z, c=z+x$. Then the given inequality becomes
$$
x^{3}+y^{3}+z^{3}+x^{2} y+y^{2} z+z^{2} x \geq 2\left(x^{2} z+y^{2} x+z^{2} y\right)
$$

Since $A M \geq G M$ we have
$$
x^{3}+z^{2} x \geq 2 x^{2} z, y^{3}+x^{2} y \geq 2 y^{2} x, z^{3}+y^{2} z \geq 2 z^{2} y
$$

After adding these inequalities we obtain
$$
x^{3}+y^{3}+z^{3}+x^{2} y+y^{2} z+z^{2} x \geq 2\left(x^{2} z+y^{2} x+z^{2} y\right)
$$

Equality holds if and only if $x=y=z$, i.e. $a=b=c$, as required. Therefore, the answer is (A) $\leq$.

## Expected Answer
(A) $\leq$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Detailed Solution:

1. Restating the inequality to be proved
   We wish to show that for any triangle with positive side lengths a, b, c,
   
   LHS := 2\bigl(a b^2 + b c^2 + c a^2\bigr)
   \le
   RHS := a^2 b + b^2 c + c^2 a + 3 a b c.

2. Justification of positivity and the use of Ravi’s substitution
   • Since a, b, c are the side lengths of a (nondegenerate) triangle, we have a, b, c > 0 and the triangle inequalities a < b + c, b < c + a, c < a + b.
   • It is standard to set a = x + y, b = y + z, c = z + x where x, y, z are strictly positive.  This parametrization automatically enforces a, b, c > 0 and the triangle inequalities.

3. Rewriting both sides in terms of x, y, z
   Substitute a = x + y, b = y + z, c = z + x into both LHS and RHS.  A direct expansion shows (after collecting like terms) that the desired inequality

     2\bigl(a b^2 + b c^2 + c a^2\bigr) \\ \le\  a^2 b + b^2 c + c^2 a + 3 a b c

   is algebraically equivalent to

     x^3 + y^3 + z^3 
     + x^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 x
   \ge
     2\bigl(x^2 z + y^2 x + z^2 y\bigr).

4. Applying the AM–GM inequality term by term
   We break the right-hand side sum into three pairs and apply the Arithmetic Mean–Geometric Mean (AM–GM) inequality in each case:

   • For the pair (x^3, z^2 x), note that x^3 > 0 and z^2 x > 0.  By AM–GM,

       (x^3 + z^2 x)/2 \ge \sqrt{x^3 \cdot (z^2 x)} = x^2 z.

     Hence x^3 + z^2 x \ge 2 x^2 z.

   • For the pair (y^3, x^2 y), similarly,

       (y^3 + x^2 y)/2 \ge \sqrt{y^3 \cdot (x^2 y)} = y^2 x,
       so
       y^3 + x^2 y \ge 2 y^2 x.

   • For the pair (z^3, y^2 z), likewise,

       (z^3 + y^2 z)/2 \ge \sqrt{z^3 \cdot (y^2 z)} = z^2 y,
       so
       z^3 + y^2 z \ge 2 z^2 y.

5. Summing the three inequalities
   Adding the three AM–GM inequalities term by term yields exactly

     (x^3 + y^3 + z^3)
     + (x^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 x)
   \ge
     2\bigl(x^2 z + y^2 x + z^2 y\bigr),

   which is the desired transformed inequality.

6. Characterization of equality cases
   • In each application of AM–GM, equality holds precisely when the two terms are equal.  Thus we require

       x^3 = z^2 x  ⇒  x^2 = z^2  ⇒ x = z,
       y^3 = x^2 y  ⇒  y^2 = x^2  ⇒ y = x,
       z^3 = y^2 z  ⇒  z^2 = y^2  ⇒ z = y.

   • Together these force x = y = z > 0.  Substituting back gives a = x + y = 2x, b = y + z = 2x, c = z + x = 2x, so a = b = c.  Hence equality in the original inequality holds if and only if the triangle is equilateral.

7. Conclusion
   We have rigorously shown

     2\bigl(a b^2 + b c^2 + c a^2\bigr) \le a^2 b + b^2 c + c^2 a + 3 a b c

   for all positive a, b, c satisfying the triangle inequalities, with equality exactly when a = b = c.

Therefore, the correct relation is “≤”.  The answer is (A) ≤
