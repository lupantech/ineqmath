    "enhanced_solution": "We wish to show that for all positive real numbers a,b,c the following inequality holds, and to determine the best (largest) constant C:\n\n  (1)   a b ·(a + c)/(b + c)   +   b c ·(b + a)/(c + a)   +   c a ·(c + b)/(a + b)\n        ≥ C · √[a b c (a + b + c)].\n\nWe shall prove the inequality with C = √3 and show that no larger C can work.  The proof proceeds by a classical substitution that transforms the left–hand side into a form amenable to a known weighted‐Cauchy–Schwarz bound.\n\nStep 1.  Introduce the reciprocal variables\n\n  x = 1/(b c),   y = 1/(c a),   z = 1/(a b).\n\nSince a,b,c>0, each of x,y,z is positive.  Also set\n\n  A = a c,   B = a b,   C' = b c.\n\nObserve that B = a b, C' = b c, A = c a.\n\nStep 2.  Rewrite each term on the left–hand side of (1).  For the first term,\n\n  a b ·(a + c)/(b + c)\n  = B · (a + c)/(b + c)\n  = B · [ (a c)/(c b) + (c c)/(c b ) ]\n    after multiplying numerator and denominator by c,\n\n  = B · [ A x + C' x ]      because x = 1/(b c)\n  = x · (B + C').\n\nSimilarly, for the second term,\n\n  b c ·(b + a)/(c + a)\n  = C' · (b + a)/(c + a)\n  = C' · [ (b a)/(a c) + (a a)/(a c) ]\n  = C' · [ B y + A y ]  = y · (C' + A),\n\nand for the third term,\n\n  c a ·(c + b)/(a + b)\n  = A · (c + b)/(a + b)\n  = A · [ (c b)/(b a) + (b b)/(b a) ]\n  = A · [ C' z + B z ]  = z · (A + B).\n\nHence the entire left–hand side of (1) becomes\n\n  x·(B + C')   +   y·(C' + A)   +   z·(A + B).\n\nStep 3.  Apply the following corollary of the Cauchy–Schwarz (or Titu’s) inequality:\n\n  For any positive a,b,c and any positive x,y,z,\n\n    x·(b + c)   +   y·(c + a)   +   z·(a + b)\n    ≥ √[ 3 · (a b + b c + c a) ].\n\nIn our situation we identify the pairings\n\n   (b + c) ↔ (B + C'),   (c + a) ↔ (C' + A),   (a + b) ↔ (A + B),\n\nso that the sum x·(B + C') + y·(C' + A) + z·(A + B) satisfies exactly the hypothesis of the corollary with the roles of (a,b,c) in the corollary replaced by (B,C',A).  Therefore,\n\n  x·(B + C')   +   y·(C' + A)   +   z·(A + B)\n  ≥ √[ 3 · (B·C' + C'·A + A·B ) ].\n\nStep 4.  Observe that\n\n  B·C' + C'·A + A·B\n  = (a b)(b c) + (b c)(c a) + (c a)(a b)\n  = a b c · (a + b + c).\n\nHence the right–hand side becomes\n\n  √[ 3 · a b c · (a + b + c) ]\n  = √3 · √[ a b c (a + b + c) ].\n\nCombining these steps we arrive at the inequality\n\n  a b·(a+c)/(b+c) + b c·(b+a)/(c+a) + c a·(c+b)/(a+b)\n  ≥ √3 · √[ a b c (a + b + c) ],\n\nvalid for all positive a,b,c.\n\nStep 5.  Sharpness and determination of the best constant.  Equality in the Cauchy–Schwarz–type corollary occurs precisely when\n\n   x : y : z  =  (b + c) : (c + a) : (a + b)\n\nand also when the three “paired’’ terms themselves are proportional.  In our substitution one checks that this condition forces a = b = c, which in turn gives x = y = z.  Thus equality in the original inequality holds exactly at a = b = c, proving that no larger constant than √3 can work.\n\nTherefore the largest constant C for which (1) always holds is √3.\n\nThe answer is $C=\\sqrt{3}$.
