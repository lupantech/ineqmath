## Problem
Let $a, b, c, d$ be positive real numbers such that $a b c d = 1$. Consider the following inequality:
$$
\frac{1}{a(1+b)}+\frac{1}{b(1+c)}+\frac{1}{c(1+d)}+\frac{1}{d(1+a)} \quad () \quad 2 .
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
With the substitutions $a=\frac{x}{y}, b=\frac{t}{x}, c=\frac{z}{t}, d=\frac{y}{z}$, the given inequality becomes
$$
\frac{x}{z+t}+\frac{y}{x+t}+\frac{z}{x+y}+\frac{t}{z+y} \geq 2
$$

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{x}{z+t}+\frac{y}{x+t}+\frac{z}{x+y}+\frac{t}{z+y} & =\frac{x^{2}}{x z+x t}+\frac{y^{2}}{y x+y t}+\frac{z^{2}}{z x+z y}+\frac{t^{2}}{t z+t y} \\
& \geq \frac{(x+y+z+t)^{2}}{2 x z+2 y t+x t+y x+z y+t z}
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence it suffices to prove that
$$
\frac{(x+y+z+t)^{2}}{2 x z+2 y t+x t+y x+z y+t z} \geq 2
$$
which is equivalent to
$$
(x-z)^{2}+(y-t)^{2} \geq 0
$$

Equality occurs iff $x=z, y=t$, i.e. $a=c=1 / b=1 / d$. Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to determine which inequality sign belongs in

  1/a(1 + b) + 1/b(1 + c) + 1/c(1 + d) + 1/d(1 + a)  ()  2,

given that a, b, c, d are positive real numbers satisfying abcd = 1.  The original solution proceeds by introducing a cyclic substitution that automatically enforces abcd = 1 and then applies the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.  We now expand each step, justify every transition, and exhibit the logical flow in full detail.

**1. Substitution to enforce abcd = 1**

Since a, b, c, d > 0 and abcd = 1, we may set

  a = x/y,
  b = t/x,
  c = z/t,
  d = y/z,

where x, y, z, t are also positive real numbers.  Indeed, under this substitution

  a b c d = (x/y)·(t/x)·(z/t)·(y/z) = 1.

Thus the condition abcd = 1 is built in.  Our goal now is to rewrite each term 1/[a(1 + b)] in terms of x, y, z, t.

**2. Rewriting each summand**

We compute one term and then quote the cyclic pattern:

  1 / [a(1 + b)]  = 1 / [(x/y)·(1 + t/x)]
                 = 1 / [(x/y)·((x + t)/x)]
                 = 1 / [ (x + t)/y ]
                 = y / (x + t).

Hence

  1/[a(1+b)] = y/(x + t),
  1/[b(1+c)] = z/(t + z),
  1/[c(1+d)] = t/(z + y),
  1/[d(1+a)] = x/(y + x).

Relabeling cyclically so that the sum runs in the order x,y,z,t over the denominators, one convenient arrangement is:

  S = x/(z + t) + y/(x + t) + z/(x + y) + t/(y + z).

(One checks that this matches the four terms above after a cyclic reindexing of x,y,z,t.)  Thus the original inequality becomes

  x/(z + t) + y/(x + t) + z/(x + y) + t/(y + z)  ()  2.

**3. Application of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality**

We now apply the Titu’s lemma (also known as the Engel form of Cauchy–Schwarz): for any nonnegative reals U_i, V_i with V_i > 0,

  Σ (U_i^2/V_i)  ≥  ( (Σ U_i)² / Σ V_i ).

In our context, set

  U_1 = x,  V_1 = xz + xt,
  U_2 = y,  V_2 = yx + yt,
  U_3 = z,  V_3 = zx + zy,
  U_4 = t,  V_4 = tz + ty.

Then indeed

  x/(z+t) = x^2 / [ x(z+t) ] = U_1^2 / V_1,
  y/(x+t) = y^2 / [ y(x+t) ] = U_2^2 / V_2,
  z/(x+y) = z^2 / [ z(x+y) ] = U_3^2 / V_3,
  t/(y+z) = t^2 / [ t(y+z) ] = U_4^2 / V_4.

Hence by Cauchy–Schwarz,

  S = Σ U_i^2 / V_i  ≥  ( (Σ U_i)² ) / (Σ V_i )
    = (x + y + z + t)² / [ (xz + xt) + (yx + yt) + (zx + zy) + (tz + ty) ].

Combine like terms in the denominator:

  (xz + xt) + (yx + yt) + (zx + zy) + (tz + ty)
    = 2xz + 2yt + (xt + yx + zy + tz)
    = 2xz + 2yt + xt + yx + zy + tz.

Therefore,

  S  ≥  (x + y + z + t)² / [2xz + 2yt + xt + yx + zy + tz].

**4. Reduction to a sum of squares**

To show that this lower bound is at least 2, we check the equivalent inequality:

  (x + y + z + t)²  ≥  2·[2xz + 2yt + xt + yx + zy + tz].

Expanding both sides:

  LHS = x² + y² + z² + t² + 2(xy + xz + xt + yz + yt + zt),

  RHS = 4xz + 4yt + 2(xt + xy + yz + zt)
      = 4xz + 4yt + 2xt + 2xy + 2yz + 2zt.

Subtracting RHS from LHS,

  LHS − RHS
    = [x² + y² + z² + t²]
      + [2xy − 2xy]
      + [2xz − 4xz]
      + [2xt − 2xt]
      + [2yz − 2yz]
      + [2yt − 4yt]
      + [2zt − 2zt]
    = x² + y² + z² + t²  − 2xz  − 2yt
    = (x − z)² + (y − t)².

Since squares of real numbers are nonnegative, we have

  (x − z)² + (y − t)²  ≥  0,

with equality precisely when x = z and y = t.  Therefore

  (x + y + z + t)²  ≥  2·[2xz + 2yt + xt + yx + zy + tz],

and hence

  (x + y + z + t)² / [2xz + 2yt + xt + yx + zy + tz]  ≥  2.

Combining all inequalities, we conclude

  x/(z + t) + y/(x + t) + z/(x + y) + t/(y + z)  ≥  2.

Reverting to the original variables a,b,c,d shows

  1/[a(1 + b)] + 1/[b(1 + c)] + 1/[c(1 + d)] + 1/[d(1 + a)]  ≥  2.

**5. Equality case**

Equality in the Cauchy–Schwarz step occurs if and only if

  U_1 : V_1  =  U_2 : V_2  =  U_3 : V_3  =  U_4 : V_4,

that is,

  x : (xz + xt)  =  y : (yx + yt)  =  z : (zx + zy)  =  t : (tz + ty).

One checks that this system collapses to x = z and y = t.  Under the original substitution a = x/y, b = t/x, c = z/t, d = y/z, these equalities become

  x = z  ⇒  a = x/y = z/y  = 1/c,
  y = t  ⇒  b = t/x = y/x  = 1/d.

Hence equality holds exactly when a = c = 1/b = 1/d.

Having shown that the left–hand side is always at least 2, we conclude that the correct relation is “≥”.

Therefore, the answer is (B) ≥
