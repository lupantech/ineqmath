## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers. Find the maximal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$:
$$
\frac{a^{3}}{b^{2}}+\frac{b^{3}}{c^{2}}+\frac{c^{3}}{a^{2}} \geq C \left( \frac{a^{2}}{b}+\frac{b^{2}}{c}+\frac{c^{2}}{a} \right)
$$

## Current Solution
By the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality we have

$$
(a+b+c)\left(\frac{a^{3}}{b^{2}}+\frac{b^{3}}{c^{2}}+\frac{c^{3}}{a^{2}}\right) \geq\left(\frac{a^{2}}{b}+\frac{b^{2}}{c}+\frac{c^{2}}{a}\right)^{2}
$$

so we only have to prove that

$$
\frac{a^{2}}{b}+\frac{b^{2}}{c}+\frac{c^{2}}{a} \geq a+b+c
$$

But this follows immediately from the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality.

Equality holds when $a = b = c$, in which case both sides of the original inequality are equal. This gives the minimum value of the left side relative to the right, so $C = 1$ is the maximal constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 1$. 

## Expected Answer
$C = 1$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to determine the largest constant C for which the inequality
  (1)    a^3/b^2 + b^3/c^2 + c^3/a^2   ≥   C · (a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a)
holds for all positive real a,b,c.  We will show by a two‐step application of the Cauchy–Schwarz (Titu’s) lemma that C=1 is the maximal such constant.

Step 1:  Reduce to a simpler comparison.
----------------------------------------
Apply Cauchy–Schwarz in the form
  (x1^2/u1 + x2^2/u2 + x3^2/u3)·(u1 + u2 + u3)  ≥  (x1 + x2 + x3)^2,
with the identifications
  x1 = a^(3/2)/b ,  u1 = b ,
  x2 = b^(3/2)/c ,  u2 = c ,
  x3 = c^(3/2)/a ,  u3 = a.
Then
  x1^2/u1 + x2^2/u2 + x3^2/u3   =   a^3/b^2 + b^3/c^2 + c^3/a^2,
and
  u1 + u2 + u3   =   a + b + c,
while
  x1 + x2 + x3   =   a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a.
Hence Cauchy–Schwarz yields
  (a^3/b^2 + b^3/c^2 + c^3/a^2)·(a + b + c)  ≥  (a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a)^2.
Dividing both sides by (a + b + c)>0 gives the equivalent inequality
  (2)    a^3/b^2 + b^3/c^2 + c^3/a^2   ≥   (a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a)^2  ÷  (a + b + c).

Consequently, to prove (1) it suffices to show
  (a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a)^2  ÷  (a + b + c)   ≥   C · (a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a).
Since the factor (a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a) is positive, this is equivalent to
  (3)    a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a   ≥   C · (a + b + c).

Step 2:  Establish the linear bound.
-------------------------------------
We now apply Cauchy–Schwarz (Titu’s lemma) once more in the form
  ∑(a^2/b)  ≥  (∑a)^2  ÷  (∑b).
Here ∑a = a + b + c and ∑b = a + b + c, so
  a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a   ≥   (a + b + c)^2 / (a + b + c)   =   a + b + c.
Comparing with (3), we see that the inequality holds with C=1.  Moreover, if we attempted any larger C>1, then for a=b=c the left‐side equals the right‐side exactly, preventing any strict improvement of C.

Equality Case and Maximality:
When a=b=c, all intermediate Cauchy–Schwarz applications become equalities, and both sides of the original inequality coincide.  Hence C=1 is attained and cannot be increased without violating the inequality in the equal‐variable case.

Conclusion:
By the above rigorous derivation, the largest constant C for which (1) holds for all positive a,b,c is C=1.

The answer is $C=1$
