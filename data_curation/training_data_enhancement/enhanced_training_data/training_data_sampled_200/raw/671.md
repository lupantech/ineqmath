## Problem
Let $x, y, z$ be positive real numbers. Consider the following inequality:
$$
\frac{x}{x+\sqrt{(x+y)(x+z)}}+\frac{y}{y+\sqrt{(y+z)(y+x)}}+\frac{z}{z+\sqrt{(z+x)(z+y)}} \quad () \quad 1 .
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
From Huygens Inequality we have $\sqrt{(x+y)(x+z)} \geq x+\sqrt{y z}$ and using this inequality for the similar ones we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{x}{x+\sqrt{(x+y)(x+z)}} & +\frac{y}{y+\sqrt{(y+z)(y+x)}}+\frac{z}{z+\sqrt{(z+x)(z+y)}} \leq \\
& \leq \frac{x}{2 x+\sqrt{y z}}+\frac{y}{2 y+\sqrt{z x}}+\frac{z}{2 z+\sqrt{x y}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, we denote with $a=\frac{\sqrt{y z}}{x}, b=\frac{\sqrt{z x}}{y}, c=\frac{\sqrt{x y}}{z}$ and the inequality becomes

$$
\frac{1}{2+a}+\frac{1}{2+b}+\frac{1}{2+c} \leq 1
$$

From the above notations we can see that $a b c=1$, so the last inequality becomes after clearing the denominators $a b+b c+c a \geq 3$, which follows from the AM-GM Inequality. Therefore, the answer is (A) $\leq$.

## Expected Answer
(A) $\leq$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to show that for all positive real numbers x,y,z,

    S  =  x/(x+√((x+y)(x+z)))
       +  y/(y+√((y+z)(y+x)))
       +  z/(z+√((z+x)(z+y)))

satisfies the inequality S ≤ 1.

**Step 1.  A lower bound for √((x+y)(x+z)).**  
Observe that
    (x+√(yz))²  =  x² + 2x√(yz) + yz.
On the other hand,
    (x+y)(x+z)  =  x² + x(y+z) + yz.
By the AM–GM inequality on the two terms x y and x z,
    x y + x z  ≥  2 x √(y z).
Hence
    x² + x(y+z) + yz  ≥  x² + 2x√(yz) + yz
                   =  (x+√(yz))².
Taking nonnegative square‐roots gives the key estimate
    √((x+y)(x+z))  ≥  x + √(y z).
By the same argument cyclically,
    √((y+z)(y+x))  ≥  y + √(z x),
    √((z+x)(z+y))  ≥  z + √(x y).

**Step 2.  Replacing each denominator.**  
From these estimates we obtain
    x/(x+√((x+y)(x+z)))  ≤  x/(x + (x+√(y z)))  =  x/(2x+√(y z)),
and similarly for the y‐term and z‐term.  Therefore

    S  ≤  x/(2x+√(y z))  +  y/(2y+√(z x))  +  z/(2z+√(x y)).

**Step 3.  Homogenization via the substitution a,b,c.**  
Define positive variables
    a  =  √(y z)/x,
    b  =  √(z x)/y,
    c  =  √(x y)/z.
A quick check shows abc = 1.  We rewrite each summand:
    x/(2x+√(y z))  =  1/(2 + (√(y z)/x))  =  1/(2+a),
and similarly the others become 1/(2+b) and 1/(2+c).  Hence it suffices to prove

    1/(2+a) + 1/(2+b) + 1/(2+c)  ≤  1
    subject to  a, b, c > 0,  abc = 1.

**Step 4.  Clearing denominators and reducing to a symmetric inequality.**  
Since all terms are positive, multiply both sides of
    1/(2+a) + 1/(2+b) + 1/(2+c)  ≤ 1
by the positive product (2+a)(2+b)(2+c).  After expansion and simplification (using abc=1), one obtains the equivalent condition

    ab + bc + ca  ≥  3.

(One can verify the algebra by writing 1/(2+a)=bc/(2bc+abc)=bc/(2bc+1), expanding each term, and comparing with the expanded form of (2+a)(2+b)(2+c).)

**Step 5.  Final application of AM–GM.**  
Since a,b,c>0 and abc=1, the AM–GM inequality gives

    ab + bc + ca  ≥  3 ( (ab)(bc)(ca) )^(1/3)
                   =  3 ( (abc)² )^(1/3)
                   =  3·1  =  3.

This establishes ab + bc + ca ≥ 3, which is exactly the needed condition.  Tracing back through the chain of inequalities, we conclude

    S  ≤  1.

Therefore the correct relation is “≤.”

The answer is (A) ≤
