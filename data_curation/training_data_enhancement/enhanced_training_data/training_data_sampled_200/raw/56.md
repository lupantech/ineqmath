## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers such that $a + b + c = 1$. Find the maximal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$:
$$
a b c + \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} \geq C.
$$

## Current Solution
By the inequality $A M \geq G M$ we get
$$
a b c+\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c} \geq 4 \sqrt[4]{a b c \cdot \frac{1}{a} \cdot \frac{1}{b} \cdot \frac{1}{c}}=4
$$
with equality if and only if $a b c=\frac{1}{a}=\frac{1}{b}=\frac{1}{c}$, from which we easily deduce that $a=b=c=1$ and then $a+b+c=3$, a contradiction since $a+b+c=1$.

Since $a b c+\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}$ is symmetrical with respect to $a, b$ and $c$ we estimate that the minimal value occurs when $a=b=c$, i.e. $a=b=c=1 / 3$, since $a+b+c=1$.

Let $a b c=\frac{1}{\alpha a}=\frac{1}{\alpha b}=\frac{1}{\alpha c}$, from which we obtain $\alpha=\frac{1}{a^{2} b c}=81$.

Therefore let us rewrite the given expression as follows
$$
\begin{equation*}
a b c+\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}=a b c+\frac{1}{81 a}+\frac{1}{81 b}+\frac{1}{81 c}+\frac{80}{81}\left(\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

By $A M \geq G M$ and $A M \geq H M$ we have
$$
\begin{equation*}
a b c+\frac{1}{81 a}+\frac{1}{81 b}+\frac{1}{81 c} \geq 4 \sqrt[4]{a b c \cdot \frac{1}{81 a} \cdot \frac{1}{81 b} \cdot \frac{1}{81 c}}=\frac{4}{27} \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$
and
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c} \geq \frac{9}{a+b+c}=9 \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

By (1), (2) and (3) we have
$$
a b c+\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c} \geq \frac{4}{27}+\frac{80}{9}=\frac{244}{27}
$$
with equality if and only if $a=b=c=\frac{1}{3}$.

Equality is achieved when $a = b = c = \frac{1}{3}$, which satisfies $a + b + c = 1$. This gives the minimum value of the expression, so $C = \frac{244}{27}$ is the maximal constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \frac{244}{27}$.

## Expected Answer
$C = \frac{244}{27}$

## Enhanced Solution
Solution (enhanced):

We wish to find the largest constant C such that for all positive real numbers a,b,c with a+b+c=1,

    abc + 1/a + 1/b + 1/c  ≥ C.

We will show by a combination of AM–GM and the simple estimate on 1/a+1/b+1/c that

    abc + 1/a + 1/b + 1/c  ≥ 244/27,

and that equality occurs exactly when a=b=c=1/3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1.  Symmetry and the guess a=b=c.
Because the expression

    F(a,b,c) = abc + 1/a + 1/b + 1/c

is symmetric in a,b,c and the constraint a+b+c=1 is also symmetric, it is natural to expect that the minimum of F under the given constraint is attained when a=b=c.  We will prove that this symmetric choice indeed produces the smallest possible value.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2.  A decomposition tailored for AM–GM.
Introduce the number 81 and split the expression F(a,b,c) as follows:

    F(a,b,c)
    = abc  + (1/(81a) + 1/(81b) + 1/(81c))  + (80/81)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c).

This splitting is algebraically exact.  Its advantage is that the first four terms

    abc,  1/(81a),  1/(81b),  1/(81c)

are four nonnegative terms to which we can apply the (ordinary) Arithmetic Mean–Geometric Mean (AM–GM) inequality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3.  Applying AM–GM to the first group of four terms.
By AM–GM on the four terms T₁=abc,  T₂=1/(81a),  T₃=1/(81b),  T₄=1/(81c), we have:

    (T₁ + T₂ + T₃ + T₄)/4  ≥  (T₁·T₂·T₃·T₄)^(1/4).

Compute the product:

    T₁·T₂·T₃·T₄
    = (abc)·(1/(81a))·(1/(81b))·(1/(81c))
    = abc/(81^3·a·b·c)
    = 1/81^3
    = 1/531441.

Hence

    (abc + 1/(81a) + 1/(81b) + 1/(81c)) /4
      ≥ (1/531441)^(1/4)
      = 1/(81^(3/4))
      = 1/27.

Multiplying both sides by 4 gives the lower bound for the first four terms:

    abc + 1/(81a) + 1/(81b) + 1/(81c)  ≥  4/27.        (I)

Equality in (I) holds precisely if and only if

    abc = 1/(81a) = 1/(81b) = 1/(81c).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4.  A simple bound on 1/a + 1/b + 1/c.
Since a+b+c=1, the Cauchy–Schwarz or the Titu’s lemma (or simply the well–known inequality between harmonic mean and arithmetic mean) yields:

    (1/a + 1/b + 1/c)
      ≥ 9/(a+b+c)
      = 9/1
      = 9.        (II)

Equality in (II) holds exactly when a=b=c.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5.  Combine the two estimates.
Using decomposition + (I) + (II), we conclude:

    F(a,b,c)
    = [abc + 1/(81a) + 1/(81b) + 1/(81c)]
      + (80/81)(1/a + 1/b + 1/c)
    ≥  (4/27)  +  (80/81)·9
    = 4/27  + 720/81
    = 4/27  + 240/27
    = 244/27.

Thus for all positive a,b,c summing to 1, F(a,b,c) ≥ 244/27.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6.  Verification of the equality case.
To achieve F(a,b,c)=244/27, both inequalities (I) and (II) must be equalities simultaneously.  That forces

  (a)  abc = 1/(81a) = 1/(81b) = 1/(81c),
  (b)  a=b=c.

From (b) we write a=b=c.  Then a+b+c=1 gives 3a=1, so a=1/3.  Substituting into abc=1/(81a) checks out:

  abc = (1/3)^3 = 1/27,
  1/(81a) = 1/(81·(1/3)) = 1/27.

Hence indeed all equalities hold, and the minimum of F is attained at a=b=c=1/3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
We have shown rigorously that the minimal value of

    abc + 1/a + 1/b + 1/c

under the constraint a+b+c=1 (with a,b,c>0) is 244/27, and that this minimum is attained exactly at a=b=c=1/3.  Therefore the largest constant C satisfying the required inequality is

The answer is $C=\frac{244}{27}$.
