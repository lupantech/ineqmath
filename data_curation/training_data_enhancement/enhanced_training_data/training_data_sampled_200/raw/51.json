Symmetry and reduction to boundary cases  \n   - The left–hand side is a symmetric, homogeneous function of degree 0 in (a,b,c).  \n   - By a standard argument using either the method of Lagrange multipliers on the sphere a^2+b^2+c^2=1, or the so-called uvw–method for three variables, a symmetric homogeneous inequality of this type achieves its extremal (minimum or maximum) value when either  \n      • two of the variables are equal, or  \n      • one of the variables is zero.  \n   - Hence it suffices to check the two cases (i) a=c, and (ii) c=0.  \n  \n2. Case (i): a=c>0  \n   Set a=c and keep b>0. Then  \n     ab + bc + ca = a^2 + 2ab,  \n     (a+b)^2 = (b+c)^2 = (a+b)^2,  \n     (c+a)^2 = (2a)^2 = 4a^2.  \n   Thus the left side becomes  \n     (a^2 + 2ab) · [1/(4a^2) + 2/(a+b)^2].  \n   We expand and simplify:  \n     (a^2 + 2ab)/(4a^2)  =  1/4 + (b/(2a)),  \n     (a^2 + 2ab)·2/(a+b)^2  = 2·(a(a+2b))/( (a+b)^2 )  .  \n   On combining these terms over a common denominator one finds after straightforward algebra  \n     (a^2 + 2ab)·[1/(4a^2) + 2/(a+b)^2]  –  9/4  =  (b·(a–b)^2)/(2a(a+b)^2).  \n   Since a,b>0, the right–hand side is ≥0, with equality precisely when a=b.  \n   Therefore in case (i) the minimum of the expression is exactly 9/4.  \n  \n3. Case (ii): c=0, with a,b>0  \n   Then  \n     ab+bc+ca = ab,  \n     (a+b)^2 as before, and (b+c)^2 = b^2, (c+a)^2 = a^2.  \n   Hence the expression becomes  \n     ab·[1/(a+b)^2 + 1/a^2 + 1/b^2].  \n   Expand and compare to 9/4:  \n     ab·[1/a^2 + 1/b^2] = b/a + a/b,  \n     ab/(a+b)^2 = ab/(a+b)^2.  \n   One checks by rewriting everything over the denominator 4a^2 b^2 (a+b)^2 that  \n     ab·[1/(a+b)^2 + 1/a^2 + 1/b^2]  –  9/4  =  ((a–b)^2·(4a^2 + 7ab + 4b^2)) / [4a^2 b^2].  \n   Since 4a^2+7ab+4b^2>0 for all a,b>0, the right side is ≥0, with equality only when a=b.  \n   Thus in case (ii) the minimum is again 9/4.  \n  \n4. Conclusion  \n   In both boundary cases the expression never drops below 9/4, and equality is attained exactly when two variables are equal and the third is either equal to them or zero (i.e. permutations of (t,t,0) or (t,t,t)).  \n   Therefore the maximal constant C for which the original inequality holds for all positive a,b,c is  \n  \n   The answer is $C=\\frac{9}{4}$.
