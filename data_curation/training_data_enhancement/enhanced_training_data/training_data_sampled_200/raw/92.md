## Problem
Let $a, b, c$ be positive real numbers. Find the maximal positive number $C$ such that the inequality below holds for all $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$:
$$
\frac{a^{2}+c^{2}}{b}+\frac{b^{2}+a^{2}}{c}+\frac{c^{2}+b^{2}}{a} \geq C(a+b+c)
$$

## Current Solution
Since the given inequality is symmetric, without loss of generality we may assume that $a \geq b \geq c$. Then clearly
$$
a^{2} \geq b^{2} \geq c^{2} \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{1}{c} \geq \frac{1}{b} \geq \frac{1}{a}
$$

By the rearrangement inequality we have
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{a^{2}}{b}+\frac{b^{2}}{c}+\frac{c^{2}}{a}=a^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{b}+b^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{c}+c^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{a} \geq a^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{a}+b^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{b}+c^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{c}=a+b+c \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$
and
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{a^{2}}{c}+\frac{b^{2}}{a}+\frac{c^{2}}{b}=a^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{c}+b^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{a}+c^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{b} \geq a^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{a}+b^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{b}+c^{2} \cdot \frac{1}{c}=a+b+c \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Adding (1) and (2) yields the required inequality.

Equality occurs if and only if $a = b = c$, in which case both rearrangement inequalities become equalities. This gives the minimum value of the left-hand side, so $C = 2$ is the maximal constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 2$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 2$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to determine the largest constant C>0 such that for all positive real numbers a,b,c the following inequality holds:

  (a^2 + c^2)/b + (b^2 + a^2)/c + (c^2 + b^2)/a  ≥  C⋅(a + b + c).

Our plan is to split the left–hand side into two similar sums, apply the rearrangement inequality to each, and then identify the maximal C.

Step 1: Symmetry and normalization
-----------------------------------
The expression on the left is symmetric in the variables a,b,c (each pair a^2/b and b^2/a appears once), and the right–hand side depends only on the sum a+b+c.  Hence we may, without loss of generality, impose an order on the variables.  In particular, assume

  a ≥ b ≥ c > 0.

Under this assumption we have

  a^2 ≥ b^2 ≥ c^2,        and        1/a ≤ 1/b ≤ 1/c.

Step 2: Decomposing the left–hand side
----------------------------------------
Write the left–hand side as the sum of two terms:

  LHS = S₁ + S₂,  where
  S₁ = a^2/b + b^2/c + c^2/a,
  S₂ = a^2/c + b^2/a + c^2/b.

We will show each of S₁ and S₂ is at least a+b+c.

Step 3: The rearrangement inequality (minimal form)
---------------------------------------------------
Let x₁ ≥ x₂ ≥ x₃ and let y₁ ≤ y₂ ≤ y₃ be two ordered real sequences.  Then among all permutations σ of {1,2,3}, the sum

  x₁ y_{σ(1)} + x₂ y_{σ(2)} + x₃ y_{σ(3)}

is minimized precisely when σ is the identity permutation (so that xᵢ is paired with yᵢ for each i).  In particular, for any other permutation π we have

  x₁ y_{π(1)} + x₂ y_{π(2)} + x₃ y_{π(3)}  ≥  x₁ y₁ + x₂ y₂ + x₃ y₃.

Step 4: Applying rearrangement to S₁
-------------------------------------
Set

  (x₁,x₂,x₃) = (a^2, b^2, c^2),   which is non-increasing,
  (y₁,y₂,y₃) = (1/a, 1/b, 1/c),   which is non-decreasing.

The ‘‘natural’’ (identity) pairing gives

  x₁ y₁ + x₂ y₂ + x₃ y₃  =  a^2⋅(1/a) + b^2⋅(1/b) + c^2⋅(1/c)
                           =  a + b + c.

Meanwhile, S₁ corresponds to the permutation π₁ with π₁(1)=2, π₁(2)=3, π₁(3)=1, so that

  S₁ = x₁ y₂ + x₂ y₃ + x₃ y₁.

By the minimality statement of the rearrangement inequality,

  S₁ = x₁ y_{π₁(1)} + x₂ y_{π₁(2)} + x₃ y_{π₁(3)}
      ≥ x₁ y₁ + x₂ y₂ + x₃ y₃
      = a + b + c.

Step 5: Applying rearrangement to S₂
-------------------------------------
Similarly, S₂ corresponds to the permutation π₂ with π₂(1)=3, π₂(2)=1, π₂(3)=2, namely

  S₂ = a^2/c + b^2/a + c^2/b
      = x₁ y₃ + x₂ y₁ + x₃ y₂
      ≥ x₁ y₁ + x₂ y₂ + x₃ y₃  = a + b + c.

Thus we obtain the two inequalities

  S₁ ≥ a + b + c,    and    S₂ ≥ a + b + c.

Step 6: Summing up and identifying C
-------------------------------------
Adding these gives

  LHS = S₁ + S₂  ≥  (a + b + c) + (a + b + c)  =  2(a + b + c).

Hence the inequality holds with C = 2:

  (a^2 + c^2)/b + (b^2 + a^2)/c + (c^2 + b^2)/a  ≥  2(a + b + c).

Step 7: Optimality of C = 2
---------------------------
To see that no larger constant can work, substitute the special case a = b = c.  Then each term a^2/b equals a, so the left–hand side becomes

  LHS = 6a,   while  a + b + c = 3a.

Thus LHS = 2(a + b + c).  If we attempted any C′ > 2, the inequality

  LHS ≥ C′(a + b + c)

would fail for a = b = c.  Therefore 2 is the maximal admissible constant.

Conclusion:
The maximal value of C for which the given inequality holds for all positive a,b,c is C = 2.

The answer is $C=2$
