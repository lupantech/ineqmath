## Problem
Let $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. Determine the minimal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$:
$$
\frac{(a+2b+3c)^{2}}{a^{2}+2b^{2}+3c^{2}} \leq C.
$$

## Current Solution
For $m_{1}=\frac{1}{6}, m_{2}=\frac{2}{6}, m_{3}=\frac{3}{6}, n=3$ by the inequality
$$
M_{1}^{m}(a, b, c) \leq M_{2}^{m}(a, b, c)
$$
which is true due to the weighted power mean inequality, we obtain
$$
\frac{a+2 b+3 c}{6} \leq \sqrt{\frac{a^{2}+2 b^{2}+3 c^{2}}{6}}, \quad \text { i.e. } \quad \frac{(a+2 b+3 c)^{2}}{a^{2}+2 b^{2}+3 c^{2}} \leq 6
$$

Equality holds when $a : b : c = 1 : 2 : 3$, that is, when $a = k$, $b = 2k$, $c = 3k$ for any $k > 0$. In this case, the expression attains its maximum value $C = 6$.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 6$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 6$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to find the smallest constant C such that for all positive real numbers a,b,c one has
  (a+2b+3c)²  / (a²+2b²+3c²)  ≤  C.

1.  Introduce suitable weights.  Set
     w₁ = 1,
     w₂ = 2,
     w₃ = 3,
  and let W = w₁ + w₂ + w₃ = 6.  We will apply the weighted power‐mean inequality to the three numbers a, b, c with these weights.

2.  State the weighted power‐mean inequality.  For any real exponents r < s and for any nonnegative weights wᵢ summing to W, one has
     M_r^w(a,b,c)  ≤  M_s^w(a,b,c),
  where
     M_r^w(a,b,c)  =  ( (w₁·aʳ + w₂·bʳ + w₃·cʳ) / W )^(1/r),
     M_s^w(a,b,c)  =  ( (w₁·aˢ + w₂·bˢ + w₃·cˢ) / W )^(1/s).  

3.  Apply it with r = 1 and s = 2.  Then
     M₁^w(a,b,c)  ≤  M₂^w(a,b,c).  
  Concretely,
     M₁^w(a,b,c)  =  (w₁·a + w₂·b + w₃·c)/W  =  (a + 2b + 3c)/6,
     M₂^w(a,b,c)  =  [ (w₁·a² + w₂·b² + w₃·c²)/W ]^(1/2)
                  =  sqrt( (a² + 2b² + 3c²)/6 ).
  Hence
     (a + 2b + 3c)/6  ≤  sqrt( (a² + 2b² + 3c²)/6 ).

4.  Square both sides and clear denominators.  We obtain
     [ (a + 2b + 3c)² / 36 ]  ≤  [ (a² + 2b² + 3c²) / 6 ],
  so multiplying both sides by 36 gives
     (a + 2b + 3c)²  ≤  6 · (a² + 2b² + 3c²).
  Equivalently,
     (a + 2b + 3c)² / (a² + 2b² + 3c²)  ≤  6.

5.  Show that this bound is best possible.  We must exhibit a choice of (a,b,c) for which equality occurs.  The equality case in the weighted power‐mean inequality (for r < s) happens precisely when the three numbers a, b, c are all equal.  Thus set
     a = b = c = k > 0.
  Then
     (a + 2b + 3c) = k + 2k + 3k = 6k,
     a² + 2b² + 3c² = k² + 2k² + 3k² = 6k²,
  and therefore
     (a + 2b + 3c)² / (a² + 2b² + 3c²)  =  (6k)² / (6k²)  =  36k² / 6k²  =  6.
  Hence the inequality cannot hold with any constant smaller than 6.

Combining the two directions shows that the minimal constant C for which the inequality
     (a + 2b + 3c)² / (a² + 2b² + 3c²)  ≤  C
holds for all a,b,c>0 is exactly 6.

The answer is $C=6$
