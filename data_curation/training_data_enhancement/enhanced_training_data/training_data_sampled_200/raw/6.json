Rewrite each term in a suggestive form.  For the first term, set  \n      T₁ = a^2/(a+2b^3) = a − (2 a b^3)/(a+2b^3).  \n  \n   Since a,b>0, we can apply AM–GM to the three positive numbers a, b^3, b^3:  \n      a + b^3 + b^3  ≥ 3·(a·b^3·b^3)^(1/3) = 3·b^2·a^(1/3).  \n   Hence  \n      a+2b^3 ≥ 3 b^2 a^(1/3),  \n   and thus  \n      (2 a b^3)/(a+2b^3) ≤ (2 a b^3)/(3 b^2 a^(1/3)) = (2/3)·b·a^(2/3).  \n   Consequently  \n      T₁ ≥ a − (2/3)·b·a^(2/3).  \n  \n   By cyclically identical reasoning,  \n      T₂ ≡ b^2/(b+2c^3) ≥ b − (2/3)·c·b^(2/3),  \n      T₃ ≡ c^2/(c+2a^3) ≥ c − (2/3)·a·c^(2/3).  \n  \n2.  Sum the three estimates.  We obtain  \n      a^2/(a+2b^3) + b^2/(b+2c^3) + c^2/(c+2a^3)  \n      ≥ (a+b+c) − (2/3)·[b·a^(2/3) + c·b^(2/3) + a·c^(2/3)].  \n  \n   Since a+b+c=3, it suffices to prove  \n      b·a^(2/3) + c·b^(2/3) + a·c^(2/3)  ≤ 3.   (*)  \n  \n3.  Bound the mixed sum by AM–GM a second time.  Observe that for any positive x,  \n      x + x + 1 ≥ 3·(x^2·1)^(1/3) = 3 x^(2/3).  \n   Replacing x by a and multiplying both sides by b/3 gives  \n      b·a^(2/3) ≤ [b·(a + a + 1)]/3 = [b·(2a + 1)]/3.  \n   Similarly,  \n      c·b^(2/3) ≤ [c·(2b + 1)]/3,   a·c^(2/3) ≤ [a·(2c + 1)]/3.  \n   Summing these three inequalities yields  \n      b·a^(2/3) + c·b^(2/3) + a·c^(2/3)  \n      ≤ [b(2a+1) + c(2b+1) + a(2c+1)]/3  \n      = [2(ab+bc+ca) + (a+b+c)]/3.  \n  \n4.  Use the classical inequality ab+bc+ca ≤ (a+b+c)^2/3 valid for all nonnegative a,b,c.  Since a+b+c=3, we get ab+bc+ca ≤ 3.  Therefore  \n      [2(ab+bc+ca) + (a+b+c)]/3 ≤ [2·3 + 3]/3 = 3.  \n   This establishes (*) and hence the original inequality with C=1.  \n  \n5.  Finally, equality throughout AM–GM holds precisely when a=b=c=1.  Thus the largest constant for which the inequality is valid in all cases is C=1.  \n  \nThe answer is $C=1$",
