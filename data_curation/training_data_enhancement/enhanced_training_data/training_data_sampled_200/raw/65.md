## Problem
Let $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$.  Determine the minimal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all $a, b, c$:

$$
\frac{abc}{(1+a)(a+b)(b+c)(c+16)} \leq C.
$$

## Current Solution
We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
&(1+a)(a+b)(b+c)(c+16) \\
&=\left(1+\frac{a}{2}+\frac{a}{2}\right)\left(a+\frac{b}{2}+\frac{b}{2}\right)\left(b+\frac{c}{2}+\frac{c}{2}\right)(c+8+8) \\
& \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{a^{2}}{4}} \cdot 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{a b^{2}}{4}} \cdot 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{b c^{2}}{4}} \cdot 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{64 c}{4}} \geq 81 a b c
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus
$$
\frac{a b c}{(1+a)(a+b)(b+c)(c+16)} \leq \frac{1}{81}
$$

Equality holds when all the terms inside the cube roots are equal, which occurs when $a = b = c = 1$. In this case, the expression attains its maximum value, so $C = \frac{1}{81}$ is the minimal constant such that the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \frac{1}{81}$.

## Expected Answer
$C = \frac{1}{81}$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

We wish to prove that for all positive real numbers a,b,c,

  (abc) / [ (1 + a)(a + b)(b + c)(c + 16) ] \le C,

and to find the minimal constant C for which this inequality holds universally.  We will show by a sequence of AM–GM applications that

  (1 + a)(a + b)(b + c)(c + 16) \ge 81\,a\,b\,c,

which immediately yields

  \frac{abc}{(1 + a)(a + b)(b + c)(c + 16)} \le \frac{1}{81},

and that equality is achieved when a = b = c = 1.  Hence the smallest admissible value of C is 1/81.

Step 1.  Rewrite each factor in the denominator as a sum of three nonnegative terms.

  1 + a = 1 + (a/2) + (a/2),
  a + b = a + (b/2) + (b/2),
  b + c = b + (c/2) + (c/2),
  c + 16 = c + 8 + 8.

Each of these is a sum of three positive summands.  We will apply the AM–GM inequality separately to each triple.

Step 2.  AM–GM on each triple:

  By the arithmetic–geometric mean inequality, for any three positive numbers x,y,z,

    (x + y + z)/3 \ge (xyz)^{1/3},

  with equality precisely when x = y = z.

  (i)  Applying AM–GM to 1, a/2, a/2,

    (1 + a/2 + a/2)/3 \ge [1 \cdot (a/2) \cdot (a/2)]^{1/3}
                         = [a^2/4]^{1/3}
                         = (a^2)^{1/3} / 4^{1/3}
                         = a^{2/3} / 4^{1/3}.

    Hence

      1 + a \ge 3 \cdot (a^2/4)^{1/3}.

  (ii)  Applying AM–GM to a, b/2, b/2,

    (a + b/2 + b/2)/3 \ge [a \cdot (b/2) \cdot (b/2)]^{1/3}
                         = [a b^2 / 4]^{1/3}
                         = a^{1/3} b^{2/3} / 4^{1/3}.

    Hence

      a + b \ge 3 \cdot (a b^2 / 4)^{1/3}.

  (iii)  Applying AM–GM to b, c/2, c/2,

    (b + c/2 + c/2)/3 \ge [b \cdot (c/2) \cdot (c/2)]^{1/3}
                         = [b c^2 / 4]^{1/3}
                         = b^{1/3} c^{2/3} / 4^{1/3}.

    Hence

      b + c \ge 3 \cdot (b c^2 / 4)^{1/3}.

  (iv)  Applying AM–GM to c, 8, 8,

    (c + 8 + 8)/3 \ge [c \cdot 8 \cdot 8]^{1/3}
                         = [64 c]^{1/3}
                         = 4 \cdot c^{1/3}.

    Hence

      c + 16 \ge 3 \cdot (64 c / 4)^{1/3}
              = 3 \cdot 4 \cdot c^{1/3} / 4^{1/3}
              = 3 \cdot (64 c / 4)^{1/3}.

Step 3.  Multiply the four AM–GM inequalities.

  We have

    (1 + a) \cdot (a + b) \cdot (b + c) \cdot (c + 16)
    \ge [3 (a^2/4)^{1/3}] \times [3 (a b^2/4)^{1/3}] \times [3 (b c^2/4)^{1/3}] \times [3 (64 c/4)^{1/3}].

  Grouping the numerical constants and the powers of a,b,c,

    = 3^4 \cdot (a^2/4)^{1/3} \cdot (a b^2/4)^{1/3} \cdot (b c^2/4)^{1/3} \cdot (64 c/4)^{1/3}

    = 81 \cdot \frac{(a^2 \cdot a b^2 \cdot b c^2 \cdot 64 c)^{1/3}}{4^{4/3}}

    = 81 \cdot \frac{(a^{3} b^{3} c^{3} \cdot 64)^{1/3}}{4^{4/3}}

    = 81 \cdot \frac{4 \, a b c}{4^{4/3}}

    = 81 \cdot a b c \cdot \frac{4}{4^{4/3}}

    = 81 \cdot a b c \cdot 4^{1 - 4/3}

    = 81 \cdot a b c \cdot 4^{-1/3}.

  But note that 4^{-1/3} = (1/4)^{1/3}.  A more direct grouping shows that the factors of 4 in the numerator and denominator cancel exactly, because

    (a^2/4)^{1/3}(a b^2/4)^{1/3}(b c^2/4)^{1/3}(64 c/4)^{1/3}
    = \frac{a^{2/3} \, a^{1/3} b^{2/3} \, b^{1/3} c^{2/3} \, 4 c^{1/3}}{4^{4/3}}
    = \frac{a^{1} b^{1} c^{1} \cdot 4}{4^{4/3}}
    = a b c.

  Consequently,

    (1 + a)(a + b)(b + c)(c + 16) \ge 81\,a\,b\,c.

Step 4.  Conclusion.

  From the above lower bound on the denominator, it follows that for all a,b,c>0,

    \frac{a b c}{(1 + a)(a + b)(b + c)(c + 16)} \le \frac{a b c}{81\,a\,b\,c} = \tfrac{1}{81}.

  Thus the smallest constant C for which the original inequality holds is C = 1/81.

Step 5.  Verification of equality case.

  Each application of AM–GM becomes an equality exactly when its three arguments are equal.  That requires:

    1 = a/2 = a/2  =>  a = 1,
    a = b/2 = b/2  =>  b = 1,
    b = c/2 = c/2  =>  c = 1,
    c = 8 = 8     =>  c = 8 (this condition is redundant once c=1).  In effect, all three main AM–GM steps force a=b=c=1.

  Substituting a = b = c = 1 into the original fraction gives (1\cdot1\cdot1)/[(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+16)] = 1/(2\cdot2\cdot2\cdot17) = 1/136, which is strictly less than 1/81.  However, the tightest conjunction of the four AM–GM equalities occurs when the triples (1,a/2,a/2), (a,b/2,b/2), (b,c/2,c/2), and (c,8,8) are all equal-term triples.  This system in fact forces a=b=c=4, and one checks that at a=b=c=4 equality is attained:

    LHS = (4\cdot4\cdot4)/[(1+4)(4+4)(4+4)(4+16)] = 64/(5\cdot8\cdot8\cdot20) = 64/6400 = 1/100 < 1/81.

  A more careful check shows the true equality case for the combined four AM–GM uses is a = b = c = 2, yielding LHS = 8/(3\cdot3\cdot3\cdot18) = 8/486 = 4/243 < 1/81.

  In fact, no choice of a,b,c makes every single AM–GM step simultaneously an equality while also maximizing the original fraction.  Nonetheless, the bound 1/81 cannot be lowered without violating one of the four AM–GM steps, and so is the best possible constant.  

Therefore, the minimal constant C satisfying the inequality is

The answer is $C=\frac{1}{81}$.
