## Problem
Let $x, y \geq 0$ be real numbers such that $x + y = 2$. Consider the following inequality:
$$
x^{2} y^{2}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \quad () \quad 2 .
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
We homogenize as follows
$$
\begin{equation*}
x^{2} y^{2}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \leq 2\left(\frac{x+y}{2}\right)^{6} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad(x+y)^{6} \geq 32 x^{2} y^{2}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $x y=0$ then the given inequality clearly holds.
Therefore let us assume that $x y \neq 0$.
Since (1)) is homogenous, we may normalize with $x y=1$.
So $y=\frac{1}{x}$, and inequality (1) becomes
$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(x+\frac{1}{x}\right)^{6} \geq 32\left(x^{2}+\frac{1}{x^{2}}\right) \tag{2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Let $t=\left(x+\frac{1}{x}\right)^{2}$, then clearly $x^{2}+\frac{1}{x^{2}}=t-2$.
Therefore (2) is equivalent to
$$
t^{3} \geq 32(t-2)
$$

Clearly $t=\left(x+\frac{1}{x}\right)^{2} \geq 2^{2}=4$.
Let us consider the function $f(t)=t^{3}-32(t-2)$ on the interval $[4, \infty)$.
Since $f^{\prime}(t)=3 t^{2}-32$ we have that $f^{\prime}(t) \geq 0$ for all $t \geq \sqrt{\frac{32}{3}}>4$, i.e. it follows that $f$ is increasing on $[4, \infty)$, which implies that
$$
f(t) \geq f(4)=0
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Leftrightarrow \quad t^{3}-32(t-2) \geq 0 \\
& \Leftrightarrow \quad t^{3} \geq 32(t-2), \quad \text { for all } t \in[4, \infty)
\end{aligned}
$$
as required. Therefore, the answer is (A) $\leq$.

## Expected Answer
(A) $\leq$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to determine, for nonnegative real numbers x,y satisfying x + y = 2, whether the following holds:

    x^{2} y^{2} (x^{2} + y^{2})   ?   2.

Our goal is to identify the correct inequality relation (\u2264, \u2265, =, <, >) and to justify rigorously that the relation is indeed “\u2264”.  The final answer will be “The answer is (A) \u2264”.  Below is a step-by-step enhancement of the original solution.

1.  Rewriting the right-hand side in homogeneous form

    Because x + y = 2, we observe that

        2  =  2 \cdot 1^{6}  =  2 \bigl(\frac{x+y}{2}\bigr)^{6}.

    Hence the inequality x^{2} y^{2} (x^{2} + y^{2}) \;?\; 2 is equivalent to

        x^{2} y^{2} (x^{2} + y^{2})  \;?\; 2 \bigl(\tfrac{x+y}{2}\bigr)^{6}.

    Since (x+y)/2 = 1, the numerical value is unchanged, but writing 2 in this homogeneous way allows us to compare two degree-6 expressions.

2.  Clearing denominators and simplifying

    Rewrite 2\,((x+y)/2)^{6} as

        2 \cdot \frac{(x+y)^{6}}{2^{6}}  =  \frac{(x+y)^{6}}{32}.

    Thus our inequality becomes

        x^{2} y^{2} (x^{2} + y^{2})  \;?\;  \frac{(x+y)^{6}}{32}.

    Equivalently, multiplying both sides by 32 > 0,

        32\,x^{2} y^{2} (x^{2} + y^{2})  \;?\;  (x+y)^{6}.

    We now study the equivalent statement:

        (x+y)^{6}  \ge\;  32\,x^{2} y^{2} (x^{2} + y^{2}).   (1)

3.  Handling the boundary case x y = 0

    If either x = 0 or y = 0 then the left-hand side of the original inequality is

        x^{2} y^{2} (x^{2} + y^{2})  = 0

    while the right-hand side equals 2.  Hence 0 \u2264 2, so the desired inequality holds trivially in this case.  We therefore restrict attention to x,y > 0.

4.  Using homogeneity to normalize x y = 1

    Inequality (1) is homogeneous of degree 6 in x and y: both sides scale by k^{6} if we replace (x,y) by (k x, k y).  Hence for x,y > 0 we may rescale so that

        x y = 1.

    Concretely, set k = 1/\sqrt{x y}, and replace (x,y) by (k x, k y).  After this change, the left side (x+y)^{6} becomes (x+1/x)^{6}, and the right side 32 x^{2} y^{2} (x^{2}+y^{2}) becomes

        32 \cdot 1 \cdot (x^{2} + 1/x^{2})

    because x^{2} y^{2} = (x y)^{2} = 1 in the new variables.  Thus (1) reduces to

        \bigl(x + \tfrac1x\bigr)^{6}  \ge\;  32\,\bigl(x^{2} + \tfrac1{x^{2}}\bigr).

5.  Introducing t = (x + 1/x)^{2}

    Define

        t  =  \bigl(x + \tfrac1x\bigr)^{2}.

    By AM–GM on x and 1/x, we have x + 1/x \u2265 2, so t \u2265 4.  Moreover,

        x^{2} + \tfrac1{x^{2}}  =  \bigl(x + \tfrac1x\bigr)^{2}  -  2  =  t - 2.

    Therefore the inequality becomes

        t^{3}  \ge\;  32\,(t - 2).

6.  Verifying t^{3} \u2265 32(t - 2) for t \u2265 4

    Define the function

        f(t)  =  t^{3}  -  32(t - 2)

    on the interval [4,\infty).  Then

        f'(t)  =  3t^{2}  -  32.

    For t \u2265 4, we have t^{2} \u2265 16, so 3t^{2} \u2265 48 > 32.  Hence f'(t) > 0 for all t \u2265 4, which means f is strictly increasing on [4,\infty).  In particular,

        f(t)  \u2265  f(4).

    But f(4) = 4^{3} - 32(4-2) = 64 - 64 = 0.  Therefore f(t) \u2265 0 for all t \u2265 4, i.e.

        t^{3}  \ge  32(t - 2),

    exactly as required.

7.  Tracing back the chain of equivalences

    We have shown that, for all x,y \u2265 0 with x + y = 2, the inequality

        (x+y)^{6}  \ge  32\,x^{2} y^{2} (x^{2} + y^{2})

    holds, and this is equivalent to

        x^{2} y^{2} (x^{2} + y^{2})  \u2264  2.

    Moreover, equality occurs exactly when x = y = 1, matching the point where each inequality in our argument becomes an equality.

Conclusion

    The correct relation is “\u2264”.

The answer is (A) 64
