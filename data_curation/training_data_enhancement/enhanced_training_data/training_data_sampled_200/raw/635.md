## Problem
Let $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. Consider the following inequality:
$$
a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4} \quad () \quad a b c(a+b+c) .
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
a^{4} & +b^{4}+c^{4} \geq a b c(a+b+c) \\
& \Leftrightarrow \quad a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4} \geq a^{2} b c+b^{2} a c+c^{2} a b \\
& \Leftrightarrow \quad \frac{T[4,0,0]}{2} \geq \frac{T[2,1,1]}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e.
$$
T[4,0,0] \geq T[2,1,1]
$$
which is true according to Muirhead's theorem. Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
Enhanced Solution:

Step 1: Reformulate both sides as symmetric sums

Let us introduce the standard symmetric sums of monomials in three variables a,b,c:

• S_{(4,0,0)} = a^4 + b^4 + c^4,  
• S_{(2,1,1)} = a^2bc + ab^2c + abc^2.  

Observe that the right-hand side of the original inequality can be rewritten as

 abc(a + b + c) 
 = a^2bc + ab^2c + abc^2 
 = S_{(2,1,1)}.

Hence the inequality we wish to prove is

  S_{(4,0,0)}   ?   S_{(2,1,1)}.  

Step 2: State Muirhead’s theorem and the notion of majorization

Muirhead’s inequality asserts that if two exponent sequences p = (p_1,p_2,p_3) and q = (q_1,q_2,q_3) of nonnegative real numbers satisfy the majorization condition

  p_1 ≥ q_1,
  p_1 + p_2 ≥ q_1 + q_2,
  p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = q_1 + q_2 + q_3,

enumerated in decreasing order, then for all positive a,b,c we have

  S_p(a,b,c) ≥ S_q(a,b,c).

Step 3: Verify the majorization condition for (4,0,0) and (2,1,1)

Order both sequences in nonincreasing order (they already are):

 p = (4,0,0),
 q = (2,1,1).

Check the partial sums:

 1. p_1 = 4 ≥ q_1 = 2,  
 2. p_1 + p_2 = 4 + 0 = 4 ≥ q_1 + q_2 = 2 + 1 = 3,  
 3. p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4 = 2 + 1 + 1 = q_1 + q_2 + q_3.

All three conditions hold, so (4,0,0) majorizes (2,1,1).

Step 4: Apply Muirhead’s inequality

By Muirhead’s theorem, for every choice of positive real numbers a,b,c we then have

  S_{(4,0,0)} = a^4 + b^4 + c^4   ≥   S_{(2,1,1)} = a^2bc + ab^2c + abc^2.

Equivalently,

  a^4 + b^4 + c^4   ≥   abc(a + b + c).

Step 5: Conclude the correct inequality symbol

Comparing with the original blank

  a^4 + b^4 + c^4   (  )   abc(a + b + c),

we find that the correct relation is “≥.”  

The answer is (B) ≥
