## Problem
Let $ABC$ be a triangle with side lengths $a, b, c$ and $\triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ with side lengths $a+\frac{b}{2}, b+\frac{c}{2}, c+\frac{a}{2}$. Find the maximal constant $C$ such that the following inequality holds for all triangles $ABC$:
$$
P_{1} \geq C P,
$$
where $P$ is the area of $\triangle ABC$, and $P_{1}$ is the area of $\triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$.

## Current Solution
By Heron's formula for $\triangle A B C$ and $\triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ we have
$$
16 P^{2}=(a+b+c)(a+b-c)(b+c-a)(a+c-b)
$$
and
$$
16 P_{1}^{2}=\frac{3}{16}(a+b+c)(-a+b+3 c)(-b+c+3 a)(-c+a+3 b)
$$

Since $a, b$ and $c$ are the side lengths of triangle there exist positive real numbers $p, q, r$ such that $a=q+r, b=r+p, c=p+q$.

Now we easily get that
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{P^{2}}{P_{1}^{2}}=\frac{16 p q r}{3(2 p+q)(2 q+r)(2 r+p)} \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

So it suffices to show that
$$
(2 p+q)(2 q+r)(2 r+p) \geq 27 p q r
$$

Applying $A M \geq Q M$ we obtain
$$
\begin{align*}
(2 p+q)(2 q+r)(2 r+p) & =(p+p+q)(q+q+r)(r+r+p) \\
& \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{p^{2} q} \cdot 3 \sqrt[3]{q^{2} r} \cdot 3 \sqrt[3]{r^{2} p}=27 p q r \tag{2}
\end{align*}
$$

By (1) and (2) we get the desired result.

Equality holds when $p = q = r$, i.e., when $a = b = c$ and the triangle is equilateral. In this case, $(2p+q) = (2q+r) = (2r+p) = 3p$, so $(2p+q)(2q+r)(2r+p) = 27p^3 = 27pqr$, and the ratio $\frac{P_1}{P}$ achieves its minimum value. Thus, $C = \frac{9}{4}$ is the maximal constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = \frac{9}{4}$.

## Expected Answer
$C = \frac{9}{4}$

## Enhanced Solution
We proceed by expressing both areas via Heron’s formula, then reducing the comparison to a single symmetric inequality in three positive variables, and finally applying the AM–GM inequality to obtain the sharp bound.

1. Heron’s formula for ΔABC
   Let a,b,c be the side lengths of ΔABC and set its semiperimeter s=(a+b+c)/2.  Then
   P=Area(ΔABC)=√[s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c)]
   ⇒ 16P²=(a+b+c)(−a+b+c)(a−b+c)(a+b−c).

2. Heron’s formula for ΔA₁B₁C₁
   The new side lengths are
     a₁=a + b/2,
     b₁=b + c/2,
     c₁=c + a/2.
   Their semiperimeter is
     s₁=(a₁+b₁+c₁)/2=[(a+b/2)+(b+c/2)+(c+a/2)]/2=3(a+b+c)/4.
   Hence by Heron,
     P₁=√[s₁(s₁−a₁)(s₁−b₁)(s₁−c₁)],
   and one computes directly
     s₁−a₁=3(a+b+c)/4−(a+b/2)=(−a+b+3c)/4,
     s₁−b₁=(−b+c+3a)/4,
     s₁−c₁=(−c+a+3b)/4.
   Therefore
     16P₁²=16·s₁(s₁−a₁)(s₁−b₁)(s₁−c₁)
            =3/16·(a+b+c)(−a+b+3c)(−b+c+3a)(−c+a+3b).

3. Standard substitution a=q+r,
                     b=r+p,
                     c=p+q   (p,q,r>0)
   This parametrization covers all triangles and simplifies symmetric expressions:
     a+b+c=2(p+q+r),
     −a+b+c=2p,
     a−b+c=2q,
     a+b−c=2r,
   so
     16P²=(2(p+q+r))·2p·2q·2r=16·pqr·(p+q+r)
     ⇒P²=pqr·(p+q+r).
   Similarly,
     −a+b+3c=2(2p+q),
     −b+c+3a=2(2q+r),
     −c+a+3b=2(2r+p),
   hence
     16P₁²=3/16·[2(p+q+r)]·2(2p+q)·2(2q+r)·2(2r+p)
            =3·(p+q+r)·(2p+q)(2q+r)(2r+p)
     ⇒P₁²=3/16·(p+q+r)(2p+q)(2q+r)(2r+p).

4. Ratio of squares of areas
   Divide to get
     P²/P₁² = [pqr·(p+q+r)] / [3/16·(p+q+r)(2p+q)(2q+r)(2r+p)]
             = 16·pqr / [3·(2p+q)(2q+r)(2r+p)].
   Therefore
     P₁²/P² = 3·(2p+q)(2q+r)(2r+p) / (16·pqr).
   To ensure P₁ ≥ C·P for all triangles is equivalent to P₁² ≥ C²·P², i.e.
     P₁²/P² ≥ C².

5. Application of AM–GM
   By the Arithmetic–Geometric Mean inequality on the positive triples (p,p,q), (q,q,r) and (r,r,p) we have
     (p+p+q)/3 ≥ (p²q)^(1/3)  ⇒  p+p+q ≥ 3·(p²q)^(1/3),
     (q+q+r)/3 ≥ (q²r)^(1/3)  ⇒  q+q+r ≥ 3·(q²r)^(1/3),
     (r+r+p)/3 ≥ (r²p)^(1/3)  ⇒  r+r+p ≥ 3·(r²p)^(1/3).
   Multiplying these three inequalities gives
     (2p+q)(2q+r)(2r+p) ≥ 27·pqr.
   Hence
     P₁²/P² ≥ [3·27·pqr] / [16·pqr] = 81/16.
   Taking square roots (all quantities positive) yields
     P₁/P ≥ 9/4
   for every choice of p,q,r>0 (i.e.or every triangle ABC).

6. Sharpness and equality case
   Equality in AM–GM occurs exactly when p=q=r.  In that case a=b=c and ΔABC is equilateral.  One checks directly that P₁/P=9/4 in this case, so the constant 9/4 cannot be improved.

Therefore the maximal constant C for which P₁ ≥ C·P holds for all triangles is
The answer is $C=\frac{9}{4}$.
