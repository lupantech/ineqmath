## Problem
Find the maximal constant $C$ such that for all real numbers $a, b, c$, the following inequality holds:
$$
\sum\left(1+a^{2}\right)^{2}\left(1+b^{2}\right)^{2}(a-c)^{2}(b-c)^{2} \geq C \left(1+a^{2}\right)\left(1+b^{2}\right)\left(1+c^{2}\right)(a-b)^{2}(b-c)^{2}(c-a)^{2}.
$$

## Current Solution
The inequality can be also written as $\sum \frac{\left(1+a^{2}\right)\left(1+b^{2}\right)}{\left(1+c^{2}\right)(a-b)^{2}} \geq 1$ (of course, we may assume that $a, b, c$ are distinct). Now, adding the inequalities

$$
\frac{\left(1+a^{2}\right)\left(1+b^{2}\right)}{\left(1+c^{2}\right)(a-b)^{2}}+\frac{\left(1+b^{2}\right)\left(1+c^{2}\right)}{\left(1+a^{2}\right)(b-c)^{2}} \geq 2 \frac{1+b^{2}}{|a-b||c-b|}
$$

(which can be found using the AM-GM Inequality) we deduce that

$$
\sum \frac{\left(1+a^{2}\right)\left(1+b^{2}\right)}{\left(1+c^{2}\right)(a-b)^{2}} \geq \sum \frac{1+b^{2}}{|(b-a)(b-c)|}
$$

and so it is enough to prove that the last quantity is at least 1. But it follows from

$$
\sum \frac{1+b^{2}}{|(b-a)(b-c)|} \geq\left|\sum \frac{1+b^{2}}{(b-a)(b-c)}\right|=1
$$

and the problem is solved.

Equality holds when $a, b, c$ are the roots of $x^3 - x = 0$, that is, when $(a, b, c)$ is a permutation of $(0, 1, -1)$. In this case, all steps above become equalities, and the value $C = 1$ is achieved. This gives the minimum value of the left-hand side, so $C = 1$ is the maximal constant for which the inequality always holds.

Therefore, the answer is $C = 1$.

## Expected Answer
$C = 1$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to determine the largest constant C for which the inequality

  ∑₍cyc₎ (1 + a²)²(1 + b²)²·(a – c)²(b – c)²  ≥  C·(1 + a²)(1 + b²)(1 + c²)·(a – b)²(b – c)²(c – a)²

holds for all real a, b, c.  We will show by a sequence of algebraic reductions, AM–GM estimates, and an exact evaluation of a cyclic sum that the sharp value is C = 1.

Step 1. Reduction to a normalized cyclic sum.  
Observe that whenever two of a,b,c coincide both sides vanish, so we may assume a,b,c are distinct.  Since (a–b)²(b–c)²(c–a)²>0 and (1+a²)(1+b²)(1+c²)>0, we divide both sides by

  (1+a²)(1+b²)(1+c²)·(a–b)²(b–c)²(c–a)²

to obtain the equivalent inequality

  ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + a²)(1 + b²)   ≥  C  · ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + a²)(1 + b²)/(1 + c²)
                ————————            ——————————————————————
                (a – b)²              (a – b)²

Rewriting, this shows equivalently

  ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + a²)(1 + b²)
             ——————————  ≥  C,
              (1 + c²)(a – b)²

so our task is to prove

  S := ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + a²)(1 + b²)
               ——————————  ≥  1
                (1 + c²)(a – b)²

and then conclude Cₘₐₓ = 1.

Step 2. Pairwise AM–GM to simplify the cyclic sum.  
Fix one index (say b) and apply the arithmetic–geometric mean inequality to the two positive terms

   X = (1 + a²)(1 + b²) / [(1 + c²)(a – b)²],
   Y = (1 + b²)(1 + c²) / [(1 + a²)(b – c)²].

By AM–GM, X + Y ≥ 2·√(X·Y).  But

  X·Y = [(1 + b²)²] / [ (a – b)²·(b – c)² ],

so

  X + Y  ≥  2· (1 + b²)/[|a – b|·|b – c| ].

Summing these pairwise estimates over the three cyclic choices of (a,b,c) gives

  ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + a²)(1 + b²)
               ——————————   ≥   ∑₍cyc₎  2·(1 + b²)/(|a – b|·|b – c|)
                (1 + c²)(a – b)²

but each cyclic pair (X+Y) contributes exactly once to the full 3-term sum S, so altogether

  S  ≥  ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + b²)/[|b – a|·|b – c|].

Step 3. From absolute sum to algebraic sum.  
Since all terms on the right are nonnegative, we have the standard inequality

  ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + b²)/[|b – a|·|b – c|]   ≥   ∣∣∣∣ ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + b²)/[(b – a)(b – c)] ∣∣∣∣.

Thus it suffices to show the exact identity

  T :=  ∑₍cyc₎  (1 + b²)/[(b – a)(b – c)]   =   1.

Step 4. Exact evaluation of the cyclic rational sum T.  
Write the common denominator D = (a – b)(b – c)(c – a).  Then

  T  =  [ (1 + a²)(b – c) + (1 + b²)(c – a) + (1 + c²)(a – b ) ] / D.

Expand the numerator N:

  N = (b – c) + a²(b – c)
    + (c – a) + b²(c – a)
    + (a – b) + c²(a – b)
    = [ (b – c)+(c – a)+(a – b) ]
      + [ a²(b – c)+ b²(c – a)+ c²(a – b) ].

The first bracket vanishes: (b–c)+(c–a)+(a–b)=0.  The second bracket is the well-known cyclic skew–sum

  a²(b – c) + b²(c – a) + c²(a – b) = (a – b)(b – c)(c – a) = D.

Hence N = D, and T = N/D = 1.  

Step 5. Conclusion.  
Combining the chain of inequalities,

  S  ≥  ∑ (1+b²)/[|b–a|·|b–c|]  ≥  |T|  = 1,

we deduce S ≥ 1 for all real a,b,c, and equality occurs precisely when equality holds in each AM–GM step and in the absolute‐value estimate.  One checks that this happens exactly when {a,b,c} = {–1,0,1}.  Therefore the maximal constant satisfying the original inequality is

  C = 1.

The answer is $C = 1$.
