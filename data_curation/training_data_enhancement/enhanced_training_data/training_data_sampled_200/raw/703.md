## Problem
Let $x, y, z > 0$ be real numbers. Consider the following inequality:
$$
(x y + y z + z x) \left( \frac{1}{(x+y)^{2}} + \frac{1}{(y+z)^{2}} + \frac{1}{(z+x)^{2}} \right) \quad () \quad \frac{9}{4} .
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
The given inequality is equivalent to
$$
\begin{align*}
& 4(x y+y z+z x)\left((z+x)^{2}(y+z)^{2}+(x+y)^{2}(z+x)^{2}+(x+y)^{2}(y+z)^{2}\right) \\
& \quad \geq 9(x+y)^{2}(y+z)^{2}(z+x)^{2} \tag{1}
\end{align*}
$$

Let us denote $p=x+y+z, q=x y+y z+z x, r=x y z$.
By $I_{5}$ and $I_{7}$ we have
$$
(x+y)^{2}(y+z)^{2}(z+x)^{2}=(p q-r)^{2}
$$
and
$$
(x+y)^{2}(y+z)^{2}+(y+z)^{2}(z+x)^{2}+(z+x)^{2}(x+y)^{2}=\left(p^{2}+q\right)^{2}-4 p(p q-r)
$$

So we can rewrite inequality (1) as follows
$$
\begin{aligned}
& 4 q\left(\left(p^{2}+q\right)^{2}-4 p(p q-r)\right) \geq 9(p q-r)^{2} \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 4 p^{4} q-17 p^{2} q^{2}+4 q^{3}+34 p q r-9 r^{2} \geq 0 \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 3 p q\left(p^{3}-4 p q+9 r\right)+q\left(p^{4}-5 p^{2} q+4 q^{2}+6 p r\right)+r(p q-9 r) \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

The last inequality follows from $N_{1}, N_{2}$ and $N_{3}$, and the fact that $p, q, r>0$. Equality occurs if and only if $x=y=z$. Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer

Enhanced Solution

Problem.  Let x,y,z>0 be real numbers, and consider the expression

    S = (xy + yz + zx) \bigl( 1/(x+y)^2 + 1/(y+z)^2 + 1/(z+x)^2 \bigr).

We wish to determine which relation holds between S and 9/4, i.e. whether

    S  ( )  9/4,

and decide which of the options (A) ≤, (B) ≥, (C) =, (D) <, (E) > is correct.

Step 1. Clear denominators.  Since x,y,z>0, each sum (x+y),(y+z),(z+x) is positive.  Multiply both sides of the desired inequality

    (xy+yz+zx)\Bigl(1/(x+y)^2 + 1/(y+z)^2 + 1/(z+x)^2\Bigr)  ?  9/4

by 4(x+y)^2(y+z)^2(z+x)^2 to obtain an equivalent inequality with no denominators.  We get

    4(xy+yz+zx)\Bigl[(y+z)^2(z+x)^2 + (z+x)^2(x+y)^2 + (x+y)^2(y+z)^2\Bigr]
      ?  9\, (x+y)^2(y+z)^2(z+x)^2.

Denote this inequality by (1).  The sign “?” remains the same because all factors we multiply by are positive.

Step 2. Introduce symmetric sums.  Define

    p = x + y + z,
    q = xy + yz + zx,
    r = xyz.

Two well-known symmetric identities (often labeled I₅ and I₇) are:

    (I₅)   (x+y)^2(y+z)^2(z+x)^2  =  (pq – r)^2,

    (I₇)   (x+y)^2(y+z)^2 + (y+z)^2(z+x)^2 + (z+x)^2(x+y)^2
           = (p^2 + q)^2  – 4p(pq – r).

Using these, rewrite both sides of (1) in terms of p,q,r.

Left side of (1):

    4q \bigl[(I₇)\bigr]
    = 4q\Bigl[(p^2+q)^2 – 4p(pq – r)\Bigr].

Right side of (1):

    9\,(I₅)  = 9(pq – r)^2.

Hence (1) becomes

    4q\bigl[(p^2+q)^2 – 4p(pq – r)\bigr]  ?  9(pq – r)^2.

Step 3. Expand and rearrange.  Expand each side and bring all terms to one side:

    4q(p^4 + 2p^2q + q^2 – 4p^2q + 4pr)
      – 9(p^2q^2 – 2pqr + r^2)  ?  0.

Collect like terms:

    4p^4q  – 17p^2q^2  + 4q^3  + 34pqr  – 9r^2  ?  0.

Factor this expression as a sum of three manifestly nonnegative terms:

    [A] = 3pq(p^3 – 4pq + 9r),
    [B] =  q(p^4 – 5p^2q + 4q^2 + 6pr),
    [C] =    r(pq – 9r).

Then

    4p^4q – 17p^2q^2 + 4q^3 + 34pqr – 9r^2
    = [A] + [B] + [C].

Thus (1) is equivalent to

    [A] + [B] + [C]  ?  0.

Step 4. Justify nonnegativity of each term.  Since x,y,z>0, we have p,q,r>0, and we use three classical inequalities:

  1. Schur’s inequality of degree 1 (N₁):
        p^3 + 9r  ≥ 4pq  ⟹  p^3 – 4pq + 9r  ≥ 0,
     so [A] = 3pq·(p^3 – 4pq + 9r) ≥ 0.

  2. A known symmetric square-sum inequality (N₂):
        p^4 – 5p^2q + 4q^2 + 6pr  ≥ 0,
     so [B] = q·(p^4 – 5p^2q + 4q^2 + 6pr) ≥ 0.

  3. The AM–GM inequality (N₃):
        p q = (x+y+z)(xy+yz+zx)  ≥ 9xyz = 9r  ⟹  pq – 9r ≥ 0,
     so [C] = r·(pq – 9r) ≥ 0.

Therefore [A]+[B]+[C] ≥0, which shows that (1) holds with “?” = “≥.”

Step 5. Characterize equality.  Each of [A],[B],[C] equals 0 exactly when x=y=z (this forces equality in Schur, in the sum-of-squares identity, and in AM–GM).  Thus the original inequality is sharp and becomes an equality precisely at x=y=z.

Conclusion.  The given expression satisfies

    (xy+yz+zx)\bigl(1/(x+y)^2 + 1/(y+z)^2 + 1/(z+x)^2\bigr)  ≥  9/4.

Hence the correct choice is (B) ≥.

The answer is (B) ≥
