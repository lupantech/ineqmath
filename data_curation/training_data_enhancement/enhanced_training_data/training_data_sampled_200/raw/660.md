## Problem
Let $x, y, z, t$ be positive real numbers. Consider the following inequality:
$$
x^{4}+y^{4}+z^{4}+t^{4}+2 x y z t \quad () \quad x^{2} y^{2}+y^{2} z^{2}+z^{2} t^{2}+t^{2} x^{2}+x^{2} z^{2}+y^{2} t^{2}
$$

Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
Clearly, it is enough to prove the inequality if $x y z t=1$ and so the problem becomes

If $a, b, c, d$ have product 1 , then $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}+2 \geq a b+b c+c d+d a+a c+b d$. Let $d$ the minimum among $a, b, c, d$ and let $m=\sqrt[3]{a b c}$. We will prove that
$a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}+2-(a b+b c+c d+d a+a c+b d) \geq d^{2}+3 m^{2}+2-\left(3 m^{2}+3 m d\right)$, which is in fact

$$
a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-a b-b c-c a \geq d(a+b+c-3 \sqrt[3]{a b c})
$$

Because $d \leq \sqrt[3]{a b c}$, proving this first inequality comes down to the inequality

$$
a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-a b-b c-c a \geq \sqrt[3]{a b c}(a+b+c-3 \sqrt[3]{a b c})
$$

Take $u=\frac{a}{\sqrt[3]{a b c}}, v=\frac{b}{\sqrt[3]{a b c}}, w=\frac{c}{\sqrt[3]{a b c}}$. Using problem 74 , we find that

$$
u^{2}+v^{2}+w^{2}+3 \geq u+v+w+u v+v w+w u
$$

which is exactly $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-a b-b c-c a \geq \sqrt[3]{a b c}(a+b+c-3 \sqrt[3]{a b c})$. Thus, it remains to prove that $d^{2}+2 \geq 3 m d \Leftrightarrow d^{2}+2 \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{d^{2}}$, which is clear. Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to prove the following inequality for all positive real numbers x,y,z,t:  

  x^{4} + y^{4} + z^{4} + t^{4} + 2xyzt  \quad ? \quad x^{2}y^{2} + y^{2}z^{2} + z^{2}t^{2} + t^{2}x^{2} + x^{2}z^{2} + y^{2}t^{2}

and determine the correct relation “?” among ≤, ≥, =, <, >.  

Original solution shows that the correct sign is ≥.  We now give a fully detailed and rigorous enhancement of that solution, following exactly the same strategy.

1. Homogenization via the product constraint
---------------------------------------------
Because the left‐ and right‐sides of the desired inequality are both homogeneous of total degree 4 in (x,y,z,t), we may impose the normalization

  xyzt = 1.

Set

  a = x,
  b = y,
  c = z,
  d = t;

so that a,b,c,d>0 and  abcd=1.  Under this substitution, the inequality to prove becomes

  a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2} + d^{2} + 2 \;\ge\; ab + bc + cd + da + ac + bd.

Equivalently,

  (1) \quad a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}+2 \, - \, (ab + bc + cd + da + ac + bd) \;\ge\; 0.

2. Splitting the left‐hand side into two pieces
------------------------------------------------
Let us write the left‐hand side of (1) as the sum of two parts:

  LHS = \bigl[a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2} 
               \, - \, (ab+bc+ca)\bigr]
        \;+
        \bigl[d^{2}+2  \,-\, (cd+da+bd)\bigr].

Observe that cd+da+bd = d(a+b+c).  Hence

  LHS = \bigl[a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2} - (ab+bc+ca)\bigr]
        \;+
        \bigl[d^{2}+2 - d(a+b+c)\bigr].

We will show each bracketed term is nonnegative, which will establish (1).

3. First bracket: convexity and reduction to three variables
-------------------------------------------------------------
Let m = (abc)^{1/3}.  Notice:
  • Since abcd=1, we have abc = 1/d, so m = (1/d)^{1/3}.
  • Because d is the smallest of {a,b,c,d}, we get d ≤ a,b,c, and hence d ≤ m.

We claim

  (2) \quad a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2} - (ab+bc+ca)
           \;\ge\; d\,\bigl(a+b+c - 3m\bigr).

Proof of (2):
 Since d ≤ m, we have

   d\,(a+b+c-3m)  \;\le\;  m\,(a+b+c-3m).

Therefore it suffices to prove the stronger inequality

  a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2} - (ab+bc+ca) \;\ge\; m\,(a+b+c-3m).

Divide both sides by m^{2}>0 and set

   u = a/m,
   v = b/m,
   w = c/m.

Then uvw = (abc)/(m^{3}) = 1, and the last inequality becomes

  u^{2}+v^{2}+w^{2} - (uv+vw+wu)
  \;\ge\;  u+v+w - 3.

Rearrange to

  u^{2}+v^{2}+w^{2} + 3
  \;\ge\;  (uv+vw+wu) + (u+v+w).

But this is precisely the known symmetric inequality (e.g. Problem 74 in the source):

  For any positive u,v,w with uvw=1,  
  u^{2}+v^{2}+w^{2}+3  \ge  uv+vw+wu + u+v+w.

Thus (2) holds, and hence the first bracket is ≥0.

4. Second bracket: an AM–GM argument
---------------------------------------
We must show

  d^{2}+2 - d(a+b+c) \;\ge\; 0.

But since a+b+c ≥ 3\,\sqrt[3]{abc} = 3m = 3/d^{1/3},
we have d(a+b+c) ≥ 3d\,m = 3d\,(1/d^{1/3}) = 3d^{2/3}.
Hence it suffices to prove

  d^{2} + 2  \ge\; 3d^{2/3}.

By the AM–GM inequality on the three positive numbers d^{2}, 1, 1, we get

  d^{2} + 1 + 1  \ge\; 3\sqrt[3]{d^{2}\cdot1\cdot1}
                 = 3d^{2/3}.

This completes the proof that the second bracket is also ≥0.

5. Conclusion
--------------
Combining the two nonnegative bracketed terms shows

  a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}+2  \;\ge\; ab+bc+cd+da+ac+bd.

Reverting to the original variables x,y,z,t (with xyzt=1) therefore yields

  x^{4}+y^{4}+z^{4}+t^{4}+2xyzt  \;\ge\;  x^{2}y^{2}+y^{2}z^{2}+z^{2}t^{2}+t^{2}x^{2}+x^{2}z^{2}+y^{2}t^{2}.

Since this inequality is homogeneous, it holds for all positive x,y,z,t without any restriction.  Hence the correct sign is “≥.”  

The answer is (B) ≥
