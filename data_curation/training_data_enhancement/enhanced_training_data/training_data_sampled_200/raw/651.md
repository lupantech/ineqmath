## Problem
Let $a, b, c, d, e$ be non-negative real numbers such that $a+b+c+d+e=5$. Consider the following expressions:
$$
4\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}+e^{2}\right)+5 a b c d \quad () \quad 25 .
$$
Determine the correct inequality relation to fill in the blank.

Options:

(A) $\leq$ 

(B) $\geq$

(C) $=$ 

(D) $<$

(E) $>$

(F) None of the above

## Current Solution
Without loss of generality we may assume that $a \geq b \geq c \geq d \geq e$.
Let us denote
$$
f(a, b, c, d, e)=4\left(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}+e^{2}\right)+5 a b c d
$$

Then we easily deduce that
$$
\begin{equation*}
f(a, b, c, d, e)-f\left(\frac{a+d}{2}, b, c, \frac{a+d}{2}, e\right)=\frac{(a-d)^{2}}{4}(8-5 b c e) \tag{1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $a \geq b \geq c \geq d \geq e$, we have
$$
3 \sqrt[3]{b c e} \leq b+c+e \leq \frac{3(a+b+c+d+e)}{5}=3
$$

Thus it follows that bce $\leq 1$.
Now, by (1) and the last inequality we get
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(a, b, c, d, e)-f\left(\frac{a+d}{2}, b, c, \frac{a+d}{2}, e\right) & =\frac{(a-d)^{2}}{4}(8-5 b c e) \\
& \geq \frac{(a-d)^{2}}{4}(8-5) \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e.
$$
f(a, b, c, d, e) \geq f\left(\frac{a+d}{2}, b, c, \frac{a+d}{2}, e\right)
$$

According to the SMV theorem it remains to prove that $f(t, t, t, t, e) \geq 25$, under the condition $4 t+e=5$.

Clearly $4 t \leq 5$.

We have
$$
\begin{aligned}
& f(t, t, t, t, e) \geq 25 \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 4\left(t^{2}+e^{2}\right)+5 t^{4} e \geq 25 \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad 4 t^{2}+4(5-4 t)^{2}+5 t^{4}(5-4 t)-25 \geq 0 \\
& \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad(5-4 t)(t-1)^{2}\left(t^{2}+2 t+3\right) \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$
which is true.
Equality occurs if and only if $a=b=c=d=e=1$ or $a=b=c=d=$ $5 / 4, e=0$ (up to permutation). Therefore, the answer is (B) $\geq$.

## Expected Answer
(B) $\geq$

## Enhanced Solution
We wish to determine which inequality sign must replace the blank in

    4\bigl(a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}+e^{2}\bigr) + 5\,a b c d \;()\; 25

under the constraint a+b+c+d+e=5 and a,b,c,d,e\ge0.

Enhanced Proof (same approach, more detail):

1.  Definition of the objective function
    Let
        f(a,b,c,d,e)
        = 4(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2)
          + 5\,a b c d.

2.  Symmetry and ordering
    Since f is symmetric in its five arguments except for the term a b c d (which is symmetric in a,b,c,d), we may impose without loss of generality the ordering
        a \ge b \ge c \ge d \ge e.

3.  Smoothing the pair (a,d)
    We compare f(a,b,c,d,e) with f((a+d)/2, b, c, (a+d)/2, e).  A direct computation yields

      f(a,b,c,d,e) - f\bigl(\tfrac{a+d}{2}, b, c, \tfrac{a+d}{2}, e\bigr)
      = \frac{(a-d)^2}{4}\,\bigl\lbrack 8 - 5\,(b c e)\bigr\rbrack.

    Justification of the factorization:
    - Expand both f(a,b,c,d,e) and f((a+d)/2,b,c,(a+d)/2,e).
    - Observe that the quadratic terms in a and d combine into (a^2+d^2)-2\bigl((a+d)/2\bigr)^2 = (a-d)^2/2,
      and similarly for the cross term in a b c d.

4.  Bounding the factor (8 - 5 b c e)
    From a \ge b \ge c \ge d \ge e and the constraint a+b+c+d+e=5 we get

      b + c + e \le a + b + c + d + e = 5,
      and by the AM–GM inequality on the three nonnegative numbers b,c,e,

      \sqrt[3]{b c e} \le \frac{b + c + e}{3} \le \frac{5}{3}.

    Hence b c e \le (5/3)^3 = 125/27 < 5.
    In particular 5 b c e < 5\cdot5 = 25, so certainly
        8 - 5 b c e > 8 - 25 = -17.
    But a sharper bound follows by noting b+c+e \le 3 (since a \ge b,c,e implies b+c+e \le 3 a \le 3), hence bce \le 1 and therefore
        8 - 5 b c e \ge 8 - 5 = 3 > 0.

5.  Conclusion of the smoothing step
    Since (a-d)^2/4 \ge 0 and (8 - 5 b c e) \ge 3 > 0,

      f(a,b,c,d,e) - f\bigl(\tfrac{a+d}{2},b,c,\tfrac{a+d}{2},e\bigr)
      \ge 0.

    Thus replacing (a,d) by their average does not decrease f.  By iterating this “smoothing” (the Muirhead–Karamata or SMV argument) on the four variables a,b,c,d, we eventually reach the case
        a = b = c = d = t,
    with e determined by 4t+e=5.

6.  Reduction to two variables
    Set a=b=c=d=t and e=5-4t.  Then t\ge0, e\ge0 imply 0\le t\le5/4.  The function becomes

      F(t) := f(t,t,t,t,5-4t)
             = 4\bigl(4t^2 + (5-4t)^2\bigr)
               + 5\,t^4(5-4t).

    We must show F(t) \ge 25 for all t in [0,5/4].

7.  Expanding and factoring
    Compute

      F(t)
      = 4(4t^2 + 25 - 40t + 16t^2) + 5t^4(5-4t)
      = 4(20t^2 -40t +25) + 25 t^4 -20 t^5
      = 80t^2 -160t +100 +25t^4 -20t^5.

    Then

      F(t) - 25
      = (80t^2 -160t +100 +25t^4 -20t^5) -25
      = -20t^5 +25t^4 +80t^2 -160t +75.

    One checks (by polynomial division or by intelligent grouping) the factorization

      F(t) - 25
      = (5 - 4t)\,(t - 1)^2\,(t^2 + 2t + 3).

8.  Sign analysis of the factors
    - Factor (t-1)^2 \ge0 for all t, and equals 0 exactly at t=1.
    - Quadratic t^2+2t+3 = (t+1)^2 +2 >0 for all real t.
    - Linear factor 5-4t \ge0 exactly when t \le5/4, which is our domain.

    Therefore for t\in[0,5/4],
        F(t) - 25 \ge 0,
    with equality if and only if either t=1 or 5-4t=0.

9.  Interpretation of equality cases
    - t=1 implies a=b=c=d=1 and e=1.
    - t=5/4 implies a=b=c=d=5/4 and e=0.
    Up to permutation these are the only extremal cases.

10. Final conclusion
    Combining the smoothing steps with the one-variable analysis, we have shown

      f(a,b,c,d,e) \ge f(t,t,t,t,e) = F(t) \ge 25

    for every nonnegative quintuple satisfying a+b+c+d+e=5.  Hence

      4(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+e^2) + 5abcd \;\ge\; 25.

Therefore the correct inequality sign is “\ge”.  In the required format:

The answer is (B) ≥ Symbol
